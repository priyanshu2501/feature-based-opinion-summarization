I bought this telephone one month ago. The best thing I like about this phone is that its standbye time is at least one week. In addition to its powerful batteries, Samsung has a very user friendly menu style. It is a very simple, long lasting and easy to use telephone. If you need a cheap and useful telephone buy this phone without any hesitations.

It is just the right phone for me.  I am a person that does not text on a daily basis.  It is a phone I find so easy to use.  It is strong.  The right size for me and I love it.  It has just everything I need even the right size of the numbers.

I ordered this phone, which was identical to the one my Mom uses. Her phone was dropped while in rehab and I decided to buy this one to replace it. However, from other reviews, I saw the same complaint regarding the ring volume but decided it might have been a fluke and ordered it anyway. My mom has extremely hard time hearing it ring if TV is on so keeps it on vibrate  also which helps somewhat. Would I recommend? NO

I just wanted a phone to talk on. This one fits the bill. The price was right and it works perfect! No problems here. I can't comment on the texting or internet features as I don't use them. Love the new phone. Works like a charm!

I was looking for an unlocked phone.  No fancy add-ons or extras.  This phone came as close as I could find.  It's a flip, hasa a camera and bluetooth.  That's more than I needed or wanted and was at a good price.  I have since recommended this phone to friends and will probably continue to do so - unless something happens to change my mind!

I bought it for my husband it works good but the blue tooth is not connecting and we have no browser access

Don't have second thoughts about this phone. Buy it is simple, easy, no nonsense, battery lasts for ever. Moderately tough little phone. 40 bucks is a steal for what you would pay from the company retailer

We purchased this unlocked phone to use while we traveled in Europe where most or all phones are unlocked. We would have appreciated knowing that it would not work outside the USA because it operates on a different frequency-I believe that was the term they used in Ireland when we took it to a phone store to be tested. Consequently, we had to purchase a phone there.

this is not an unlocked phone. it is supposed to be but it isn't. don't buy this phone if you are looking for an unlocked phone.

The phone works fine but "unlocked" doesn't quite cut it for the AT&T network. This T-mobile phone works with my At&T sim card but I cannot send or receive MMS (picture texts.) I talked to AT&T and they said there is nothing they can do. This phone is also not so great about picking up AT&T signal. It will often show service bars but say that I can only make emergency calls. I work in an area where AT&T service is poor, but it is far worse with this phone than with my late iphone 3G.

I was wanting this for my son's US Cellular but it wasn't compatible.  However, I was able to use this on our AT&T line; works great

Decent phone, worked well for a year. Then one day it stopped working all of a sudden. The phone wont start up. It just diplays a red error code FFFFFFFF and the keypad lights flash. Cell phone repair centers could not fix it. Samsung service ias asking $70 to fix it (twice the price of the phone!)

For a flip-top cell this meets all requirements.  This replaced a sony ericissonand I am pleased I selected this phone.  This was a new phone and I willnever again purchase a reconditioned phone.

I had an original phone that finally gave up and wanted something simple. This phone was exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use, good sound, dependable.

Great durable phone for my non-tech savvy husband.  This does the job for him with relatively no frills.  Very happy with this purchase.

The texting always sends a fail to send and the signal is lost a lot. And the date and time changes for no reason. It's a piece of crap![[ASIN:B004EUJD9Q Samsung T139 Unlocked Phone with Camera, Bluetooth, U.S. Warranty - Not for verizon/sprint users]

Good phone for the money I bought the unlocked phone for my mom in Nigera.I like the look and functionality of the phone.She likes it too, and it is easy for to use

what can I say ,,love this phone for simplicity ,,easy to use ,,five star for the seller..i recommend to every one who just  love a simple communication,,,

Phone died within two months.  Samsung has had it for a month, claiming they are waiting on a part. Don't expect to ever see it again.  Buy another phone, for your own sake.

I'm very disappointed in this phone. I ordered because need an unlocked phone, like the description says, but it's no true, my phone came locked, it's a prepay phone with a big sticker on the screen saying how to check "my minutes". It's the second time for me, that a description of the phone in Amazon is not the description of the phone they send you.

I ordered an unlocked phone to gift it to my parents back home in India. I ordered this phone from the link which is specifically meant for UNLOCKED PHONES and everywhere they labled it as a Unlocked phone. When my parents tried to activate a SIM it didnt work and later on found out that its a locked phone.Now the phone is useless for them. Don't understand how come big names like Amazon do such things. They should properly check before they sell a product. really frustrated and wont suggest buying such things from Amazon

I purchased this product a few months ago and it it absolutely great. i use it with at&t it is unlocked but this phone has a very bad radar. when im indoors, the radar is fully down and i cant make calls.other than that the phone is amazing and it is worth 35.00

Phone died with flashing keys and display after being used for two phone calls in three months. Purchased another phone. Would give zero stars if it were possible.

If i bought this can i just put my old sim card in without having to call t mobile or doing else to it..Thanks for the samsung t139

This item is ok. For that price we should not expect the best. The seller should tell customer about 10 - 20 second delay time when dial someone. Unless I have received the defective product. Over all it is ok.

Solid simple basic phone. I bought this for my pops, simple to use and hard to break, can't go wrong.

My husband hated my old Blackberry Storm and wanted to go back to a flip phone.  He loves this phone.  He's not much of a techie.  I have a Droid and can't wait to upgrade to Droid 4G--but want to wait for them to come out with a slider key board.  So if you want to just use your phone to call people (he doesn't even take pics with it!) this is a great phone for you.

on the website it mentioned in the add that the phone was unlocked but when i received it and sent to india it did not work. the phone wasnt unlocked......other wise the battery life on this phone is amazing.....worth the money

I did like all the features and it worked pertaining to calling but the earphone volume was too low and I didn't find a method to increase the volume.  This is all is didn't like on the phone and it was a necessity for me.

I purchased the Samsung unlocked phone from Amazon for my travels abroad.  However, when I arrived at my destination and tried to use the phone, it didn't work.  Despite trying various SIM cards (which worked just fine in other phones), I realized that there was a problem with this phone, which I purchased brand new.  I don't see any customer service options through Amazon, but if anyone from Amazon is reading this please contact me to resolve this issue.  It's a shame to pay $35 for a non-working phone.

I purchased two of these phones for my wife and me in Sept. 2011 to use with our T-Mobile pay as you go accounts. My use was limited. My wife used it much more, especially for texting. Her phone died after one year. Mine is still working OK. You can get one at Wal-Mart for $30.00. Swap out the memory chip and you're good to go. If all you need is light use, then they're OK. Otherwise, invest in a better phone.

Great phone

I didn't read the negative reviews before buying so I also ended up with a locked phone. And I didn't find this out in time to return so now I have a useless locked phone to dispose.It's hard to believe they're deceiving customers and still making a profit thanks to Amazon. I just opened a complain with them, we'll see how it goes.

One of the phone in our contract was broken a few months before AT&T; contract was over. So we were looking for cheap unlocked phones. Finally we bought this phone just for few months. Unfortunately this was not good even for 3-4 months. Within weeks we had to order another unlocked phone. (We bought Xperia X8 which sucked but lasted for few months then we got iPhone4s).THE PROBLEM, with this phone is that the voice quality of the calls were not good. The voice was breaking. It wasn't the network because the other phone in our contract was fine and we live in the area where we have good reception.Giving it 2 stars, just to let others know that it is "working" phone. You can make calls, receive calls, set alarm etc. So if call quality is not of utmost importance for you then you can think of buying this because it's not that costly compared to other unlocked phones

My iphone broke so I got this phone as a temporary phone until my contract is up in a few months. I thought the iphone had poor call quality, but this is even worse. It is shaped seemingly well to place the microphone properly but no one can hear me very well on calls.The build quality seems fine for a cheap phone and the battery life is good. I paid $30 at target.

This is a very good phone for seniors citizens, broke folks, and cheap skates who want reliability and simplicity. It is light and has large number dials along with huge digital fonts. I highly recommend this phone if these details don't offend the users. It really is a great reliable phone for talking and texting.

The phone was totally brand new, in the box. It was exactly as advertised, which was unlocked.It is a simple, uncomplecated phone which I bought for my grandmother who didn't want something that was 'high tech'.Everything works and the camera takes good pictures in a pinch, all in all this is a great phone for the price and for someone who only uses their phone occassionally.

I just needed a phone to make calls and texts that also included a camera. I have AT&T and my signal would be weak to none when I&#8217;m inside elevators. Battery life is amazing.

I purchased this phone for my elderly father who needs a simple phone for voice calls only. This phone has some excellent features for older users, including nice large buttons, a simple interface, and large font that displays the number being called. Unfortunately, the loudest ringtone set at the maximum volume was still significantly quieter than other cellphones of this general type that he and I have used in the past, and the voice audio quality was very poor, with low volume, distortions, static and skips. I have returned the phone.

I don't like smartphones and was very disappointed with the LG flip-phone that AT&T gave me when I renewed my contract.  My wife had a really nice Samsung flip-phone through T-Mobile so I ordered this one and, while it is not the same phone my wife has, it is really nice for someone who only uses a phone to talk to people with.  Good sound quality, decent, not-great camera, and much more solidly built than the LG phone I had.  I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good basic phone.

At first was OK, a very basic phone and didn't expect to be a long life.  However, with minimal usage (calling only) and less than 9 months is totally not acceptable.

nicely package.  in great condition.all info and accessories inside.we will do business with you again.thank you so much.

The first one I ordered arrived DOA--shipped back to Amazon and ordered a replacement. The second one worked fine EXCEPT the blue-tooth feature, which would not work with the hands-free car speakerphone or the blue-tooth enabled Garmin GPS in the other car. Shipped the second one back; did not try for a third one. I just noticed they are presently not available on Amazon; I wonder if they are having problems and pulled them. Best part of the deal was the Amazon return policy which would get 5+ stars.

You all know how these phones are. They are indestructible for the most part. It worked until i got a new phone.

simple phone for people who want &#34;JUST A PHONE.&#34;

I am not satisfied with this product. Upon getting this phone, I had to be on travel, where I, by mistake, changed this to phone. But it did not work in any other network except T Mobile. If I put the AT&T SIM or any other SIM other than t-mobile, it says error. does not work. by the time, I come back to my home town, my return period ended. this is the first time, I am seeing a product from amazon, does not fulfill what is mentioned in the product details. not a good seller.

I was disappointed in this phone.  I ordered a car charger at the same time and it came within a couple of days and then it took about 2 weeks for the phone to arrive.I was looking for a simple flip phone but this phone is really old technology.  The phone would disconnect me in the middle of calls.  I ended up changing from Tmobile to Verizon to get the phone I wanted after 5 days of using this phone.

Everyone in our family has these and we use them with T mobile prepaid.  They are good phones for the price, loud sound, can use bluetooth and big buttons for dialing.However, you will NOT be able to get the photos off of it with a cable or Bluetooth.  You have to send them to your email, which costs minutes on prepaid.  The ability to do so is disabled on the Tmobile prepaid version of this phone.  The guys at the store do not know this, and sold me a cable. After speaking to Tmobile when struggling to download photos I was told this was true.

This is my 3rd one these.  I have a problem with washing, and swimming with them.  They are a good basic phone.

Very durable and easy to use. even been dropped in a puddle. Dried off laterand it still works great.

the phone was NOT unlocked, which is why i bought it in the first place...so im very disappointed...and i cant even contact the seller to atleast get the unlock code to open it myself... what a waste...

Samsung T319 I bought is a nice and good cellphone. I don't have any problem with it since am using it. so everybody can also try it .... thanks

The cell phone is "Locked".The description is wrong!  I contacted Samsung, and they asked me to contact the service provider to get "Network Control Key" .  I contacted T-Mobil.  They said I don't have an account with them, because I have AT&T; sim card.I go back and forth so many times then found out that Samsung did not put out that description.  The only one put out the description is the seller which is Amazon.  I called Amazon to have this error corrected.

I received my Samsung T139 today!  I had a T139 cell prior to ordering this one.  However, I accidently washed mine when I forgot to check my pockets and threw my jeans in the washer (hate to admit, but it happens)!  EcoCell provided me with excellent service, prompt delivery, perfect packaging, and a totally great product!  Thank you, EcoCell for being so prompt.  I can now retire my husband's old phone (which is an extremely old model that I am not used to) that I was borrowing until I received my replacement T139 cell.  If it were possible, I would absolutely give EcoCell and the cell phone ten stars!!!

Neither good nor bad, it's a decent phone for the casual user like myself. I rarely use the camera since I carry my "real" camera with me, but it does take good pics. I don't use the internet and all the apps, because my plan doesn't support them. All in all, it's a good phone for the money.

Hi I usually dont write reviews but this review is for all prospective buyers, this phone is locked to T-mobile, It does not work with any other network. i bought it as a backup phone to use a different simcard paid $40+ for phone as it said unlocked.it is useless for me now. better get a t-mobile no-contract phone if you want a backup phone else it is just useless.I bought many things from amazon but this is useless.

great phone,  good for senior elderly to use,  unlocked and affordable and comfortable in the hands.

I was looking for a flip-phone that had good call and sound quality and would be easy to text with. This phone is perfect for both, without any extra features or apps (which I didn't want to spend money on to begin with).I have owned and used this phone for about a week now, with T-mobile.It's speaker volume and clarity as well as when you hold it up to ear are both excellent. This is a great simple phone if you are looking for basic functions only. It's nicely sized, not too bulky to fit in a small pocket, and is very light. Connected to my bluetooth ear-piece easily, and worked well. The only thing is the phone is made of plastic which makes me want to get a rubberized cover for it in case it falls or gets scratched. Over all I am very pleased with this phone!

I purchased this phone when I came to US and realised my own phone will not work on the available networks. Since I had an international sim and was hard pressed for cash, I decided on this phone primarily because of the looks when compared with the other phones in this price range.The phone is easy to use and has a quite sturdy build. The flip cover has not loosened after 2 months of rough usage and the surface does not attract dust or scratches.The buttons on this phone are bigger than the average cellphones. I did have some trouble while trying to message on this phone. People who are used to message more patiently might not have any problems. Software is simple enough for anyone to get by.All in all, a good phone for people who need it for what it is supposed to be - a phone for calls and messages.

I wanted to ditch my smart phone and go back to the basics so i bought this phone. when i did my search on Amazon i entered &#34;At&t basic flip phone&#34; and there wasn't much selection, but some were posted as &#34;unlocked&#34; and can be used with any carrier. This one however was listed as an At&t phone which was not accurate, it's actually an unlocked T-Mobile Phone. The phone itself works great, and it's pretty much what i needed, but the listing is misleading and well, when i buy something online i need all the info on the product to be accurate. I want to know exactly what I'm getting for my hard earned money. Other than that, I'm back to the stone age with my Cell phone ha ha ha

always hesitate when changing phones, or electronics in general?Have no fear this was the easiest transition to date for me.Maybe getting older has something to do with it

Do not buy this product, Samsung T139 "unlocked" phone, if you want an unlocked phone.  I had two sent to me and neither was unlocked.  This product has caused me lots of frustration and wasted effort.  I was told by amazon to contact T-mobile who told me to find and pay for an unlock code online.  I do not appreciate the run around, especially when I am abroad and in school.

Very poor signal quality even in locations where signals from the same service provider on a different phone were good to excellent. Returned it to Amazon. We bought the LG Lollipop and its signal reception is much better!

This is a simple, sturdy phone. AT&T had a limited choice in flip phones, and I do not have to another 2 year commitment.

Good phone for those that don't want any frilly extras. It's simple and easy to use.It has a camera, speaker phone, and can text SMS and picture messages. Large buttonsfor those that don't want to squint just to dial a number. This phone is a replacement formy Mom after her other crappy phone broke. Thus far, it's a great replacement and works just fine.

i liked the size but it kept turning the volume off and i wouldnt know when i had phone calls

BUENISIMO, MUCHO MUCHO, ES UN REGALO PARA SU PRECIO. TIENE UNA EXCELENTE CAMARA. AUNQUE ES DE BAJA RESOLUCI&Oacute;N TOMA UNAS FOTOS BUENAS.

I bought this flip phone for my parents both over 60 years old. They wanted a simple flip phone. In the package was the phone, charger, manual, ear phones, and a phone holder. I surprised to see the phone holder. None the less it works and my parents love the simple flip phone and the holder. You can access internet on the phone. My parents just want to call and try texting. I told them to be careful and not explore the phone to much for if they do access the internet on it its 1.99 a minute. As a text popped up when  I first activated the phone. The phone is flat and can fit in the palm of my hand. My parents love this phone so far it fits right in their pockets.I searched much online for a good flip phone. Until I came to amazon. I read all the reviews before making this purchase. I learn a lot about the product and most of my questions were answered because of the reviews. Thanks to all your folks out there that take the time to put up reviews it really helped me a lot in this buy.The buyer shipped this phone within a week I bought it. Packaged was wrapped well. Totally buying from this buyer again!!

This phone turned out not to be unlocked at all.  I bought it for my mother and was very disappointed that it was not what it was advertised to be.  The sellers seemed to have great difficulty writing English, at least their spelling was terrible.  When I sent for the return label and told them the reason for the return, they offered to unlock the phone for me.  I was able to get it returned without having to pay return postage.

I also was looking for a basic flip phone to go with my prepaid T-mobile service after my Motorola quit working. I use it as an "emergency phone" and this exceeded my expectations [which are also basic]. However, I mail-ordered it for $19.99 from WalMart. Can't imagine anyone paying $49.99 [although that's what T-mobile charges for it as well] for a lightweight plastic phone!

If your're looking for a phone that works great and don't want tobother with high tech stuff, this phone is great.I bought this phone for my husband, it's simple and easy to use.

Read reviews before I purchased this phone, some negative review feedbacks are about unlocked or not. That was only concern I had. After it arrived I put my wife's tmobile sim card in, everything works perfectly. This is exactly the phone for my wife, easy to use.

My mother, like many elderly people, wanted &#34;just a phone.&#34; She does not text or email or go online or do anything except talk on a phone, and a landline did not suit her needs. She also goes through cell phones like mad because she keeps getting them wet with &#34;just a teenie, tiny bit of water.&#34; So I was REAL glad to find a cheap phone on Amazon, especially seeing as T-Mobile had exactly 1 phone that was &#34;just a phone&#34; and for twice the price of this one. So I took a gamble and ordered this one for her.Apparently it's really easy to use. So easy that Mom, who could never program her VCR, has figured out how to take pictures of her cat with it. She's quite hard-of-hearing and has had no trouble hearing the phone ring, and I don't have to yell at her when I call her. She was thrilled that her contacts that were saved onto her old SIM card transferred to this phone just fine when I installed the card and booted it up. She especially loves just having to flip the phone open to answer, and snap it closed to hang up.It's only been about a week, but so far, this phone is a huge win, both for her ease of use and for my budget.

This phone was recommended to me by friends.  I travel to Europe and the Caribbean and really felt the need for a worldwide phone.  This one really fills the bill.  Set up is easy and it works everywhere that I need it.  The company has a good reputation and I feel confident that all will be well.  I'm not the kind of person who needs all the "bells and whistles" on their phone.  I need to make and receive calls, period.  So this is more than adequate for my purposes.  What really surprised me was how fast the shipping turned out to be.  Using regular FedEx shipping I had the phone in a day.  That's great!The ease of use is great for a non-technophile like me.  I really like that you pay only for what you use.  You're not saddled to a monthly plan that you feel compelled to use to get your money's worth.  All in all, I'm very satisfied with the product and look forward to a long association with the company.

It works just fine for my needs..Make and receive calls.. can't ask for more..Love the little phone. It gets the job done ...

I got mine at best buy for $36-$40 as an emergency phone after my good phone got dropped in a glass of soda. The camera is no good. The web is no good. can't receive and store contact card info very easy.

Great phone. It has been tested with a Mexican Telecel sd card and sent a text message very quickly. Highly recommend to anyone that is looking for a cheap unlocked phone to use outside the US.

Excelent...

The cell phone is filling expectations for the price. The battery does not deliver as expected, with very few capacity of operation, even when the phone is on, but not used.

I've had several of the T139's, (my recent order was for 5 from you) which I use as spares for my T-Mobile accounts,  but until now simcards always came with them, even the ones from Walmart.  Fortunately I have a couple of some simcards, which I can use if one of my other phones stops working.  But if one of my other phones is LOST, I might be stuck without simcards, which I find an unnecessary problem I shouldn't have to deal with.  Yes.  That is a complaint.  G.

i ordered this phone because my mother wanted a FLIP Phone...I just inserted her card it was perfect.Thanks very much

Just needed a simple to go phone with the basic. So far from day one, it seems like the type of phone i need. Only thing i don't like at the moment is the reception bars. Seems like with a more costly phone i get better reception than i do with this phone, once outside, it's not a problem.

Samsung phone arrived in good time and works as advertised. It is a pretty basic phone but that is all we needed.

Ordered a phone for AT&T, but this one was meant for T-Mobile.  It did work on my network, but never too reliable.  However, for the cost, it served my purposes.

I've purchased 6 of these phones over the past 2 or 3 years for fleet phones for work.  I buy them because they're perfect, basic, reliable phones that do the job.  Never had a problem.

But, not a 3G/4G or Voice over Wi-Fi capable. This one has good reviews, especially good for most over 90+ seniors. But, we never even opened it up. Needed a Voice over Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet for data and voice calls to England since my senior parents have friends over there. mVoIP is free of data charges! Now, does anybody have experience teaching a 95 year old to use a Samsung Galaxy Light (T-Mobile) touch screen minature computer that happens to be a cell phone?

This was a replacement phone for the broken one. It is perfect for any teen starting out. Basic but worth the money.

I cannot say how many times this phone has been dropped but it is still working like a charm! Great phone, easy to use and has not failed me yet.

I purchased this phone for an older friend of mine, 82 years old to be exact.  He has been using it for the past week and loves it, he had a Motorola razr but it finally gave out on him.  I was a little worried when I opened the box and the phone said T-Mobil since I was using my att sim card, but it worked fine.  my friend says the the volume and ringer are both louder on this phone (which is a good thing when your are 82).  I set the font to a larger size for him which he really likes and the price what very good.  The only thing I would mention to any potential buyer is:  don't purchase a Separate charger like I did, one comes packed with the phone.  There is a camera but I didn't even try it since all it was bought for was to talk on.  Good phone, good price and easy to use.

I bought this product in August 2011 and sent to a friend of mine in abroad as a gift which never worked for him. I am unsure if this was sold unlocked. I am very unhappy with this product.Samsung T139 Unlocked Phone with Camera, Bluetooth, and Speakerphone--U.S. Warranty (Black)

I almost did not buy this phone because of some poorly thought-out reviews.  I am finding this phone to be an outstanding buy.  It works well.  It has a clear display, and all features work as expected.  In other words, I am perfectly happy with it.  I am aware there are other types of phones in the marketplace, but for those who want a fairly simple, reliable, easy-to-understand phone -- this is it!

The Cell Phone turned out to be what I expected, except for one flaw....I cannot install a ringtone of my choice...Barton

The phone was exactly as described by the seller.  Worked great.  Was fully charged when received.  Have no complaints at all!

Pro'sSturdy: Dropped it from the second floor and survived without a scratch.Great battery lifeConsNo Alarm clockNo 3G network, therefore reception is quite unstable at times.Summary:Very good phone for the price.

Like the title says, it only does what is stated not anything more. The most annoying things about it are:1. No file transfer whatsoever unless you have a data plan, or want to text to your email address or my.t-mobile.com.2. Only allows midi or polyphonic ringtones which you ether have to have data to get any of those.3. Texting inbox and sentbox fill up VERY quickly and do not auto-delete. Meaning, once full, you cannot even look ant any texts coming in until you delete a whole bunch of garbage... exceptionally frustrating when in a hurry.4. Even if you do have data with your plan, you can go to very few websites and their "bite-size" version at that. If you go to a website that is too big, the browser quits and you go to your start page or the phone flips out and restarts. Again, EXCEPTIONALLY FRUSTRATING!!!There are numerous other bugs, but I did give it a two-star rating, because of the general ease of use. And, the call quality is good, loud and the speaker-phone quality is very decent considering everything else.My suggestion, DO NOT BUY this phone unless you have to. On t-mobile or AT&T;, you can find much better phones for the same price if you search for unlocked quad-band GSM phones. For really non-techy people, this phone may be your thing.

the product looked like it was in good conditon until i figured out that the charger does not work and the phone was not being charges. i haven't been able to get a replacement charger to see it that is the true problem or if it is the phone itself.

I was concerned after reading some of the reviews about buying this phone. But I took the plunge and got it well it was brand new and came with a charger. It has Bluetooth which I use in my car Uconnect system. It has great volume, nice size screen, the buttons are large, and for me it is a easy phone to use and operate. It does have it's limitations but so far for me not for my using it.

reception not to good.

this phone does not work very well , antenna seems be not getting a signal half of the time disconects all the time while driving

Edit; the second copy I ordered sold by Amazon was received, but is non-functional on AT&T; in Atlanta. The supplier appears different than the first copy. There may be a QC issue with ensuring these are unlocked. This 2nd phone is being returned for refund. There may be some issue with new SIM cards from AT&T; not working with unlocked phones. Before returning, try with an existing SIM from another phone to see if it can connect to the network.Original review from first copy:I think most of the negative reviews are from those taking the T139 out of North America. This dual-band phone isn't compatible with most GSM systems outside of the US. For those markets you may need a quad-band phone.This phone is an unlocked, branded, T-mobile phone intended for the US market. It appears to be new/unused except perhaps to be unlocked; it still had sealed bags around the battery and battery cover, and protective clear covering over displays. Documentation is copyrighted 2010. Purchased from Amazon and not a partner.It came oddly packaged in a hard, zippered, multi-pocketed container. Shrug. Maybe it was intended for the teen set. The graphical icons seem a little juvenile; it won't make a good impression on a date.Form, function, and build quality are all very good, if all you want is a cellphone and not some sort of electronic swiss-army knife. User interface is intuitive. Instruction book is comprehensive. Sound quality is great and reception is good. Battery life is good.We use it on AT&T;'s network here in Atlanta. Popped in the SIM card from a dying 5 year old nokia phone and it worked immediately with no fuss. Took a minute or two to initialize its phone book from numbers stored on the sim card.Highly recommended for use in the U.S.

I bought this phone refurbished from Cellular Gallery inc., it arrived right on time, looked like new one, and professionally packaged. I asked them to return the phone later because I had no need of it, the costumer service were professional enough, I got it returned and was refunded ~$30 -they said it was because the seal was open science I used the phone once to ensure it was working-.The phone itself looked pretty good. Totally recommend the phone and the seller

I bought it for my mom in the congo and when i got there, the phone could not work. It says that it is unlocked, that does not seem to be true. I put the sim card and the phone did not work. I called and emailed both tmobile an samsumg and nobody could help me out. Very disappointed.

Good phone it replaced an older model that my wife had.  Her comment, I don't have to go thru the learning curve.

The phone came quick and was as advertised.  The ring is not as loud as I would like but has plenty of features and good battery life.

All you need for talking it has some etc. but perfect for talk/text all you will need for the basics. Very nice phone for a nice low price. (JUST FOR TALKING)

Totally adequate basic phone.  Decent reception, sound, speaker phone, etc.  Fired right up, just dropped in my sim card.  No major complaints.  Menus a bit fiddly, but they all are.  No frills and I don't need any.  Battery life multiple days, no complaints.

My boyfriend dropped his phone in a river, so we wanted to replace it with the exact same thing, and found this on Amazon for a reasonable price and from a seller with excellent customer service.  Thanks!

I bought this for a trip to Guatemala because traveling alone, I knew I'd feel safer with a phone. As soon as I got to Antigua Guatemala, I bought a SIM card at a small shop and was ready to go. The phone worked perfectly.

i bought this "unlocked phone" so i could use it in Costa Rica. It didnt work at all... im not sure if it is not really unlocked(i've bought 5 cellphones, and all of them works perfectly here), or if it was DOA... The fact is that it did not work. Thats why the 1 star rating.

I love this phone. I bought this cell phone for my 12 yr old son. I think having a smartphone is too expensive and too easy to for him to get into trouble bc of the Internet and social media sites. The phone is great. That's all I need to get in touch with him. Thanks

It works fine.  I didn't know this but be aware that in the tools of this phone, there is NO setting for an alarm feature.  If I knew this, I would not have bought it.  But for its working and other features, good travel phone, that's what I use it for.

This is a basic phone, and I use it as a phone -- to place and receive calls.  It is not a PC, it is not an entertainment center, it does not drive my car, feed my dog or let out the cat.  If all you want is a phone, you could ask for no more.

I purchased the T139 from this company. The product is great for the money. Unlocked Cellphones, by it very name, is a business concept guarantee of cell phone compatibility with your cell phone service provider. Should you have any problem with your provider denying its compatibility then insist that your provider test your Unlocked Cellphone with an unlocked SIM card. You can expect excellent customer service and follow through from this company.

I like this phone because it's simple. And besides I'm not ready for a SmartPhone.  Samsung makes a good quality flip phone.

I had no complaints with this but we decided it was time to get a smartphone.  But, this little Samsung was great.

this is a good cell phone, it's good for people the need a phone, not a computer that makes calls. best phone of this type I ever had. the only thing is the USB cable will not connect the phone as a link so i can load files. and in my car hands free info read out, it will not show signal level.

The top part of the phone is not tight enough. I can only hope that it will last. It was for my 64 years old mother and she ONLY talks on it,that is why we are not returning it.

Ordered the Samsung T139 because of the low price, it was unlocked, I prefer a clamshell, it had Bluetooth and a speakerphone. However, I live in a fringe area and the signal reception was unreliable.  The phone showed 0 or 1 bar most of the time.  Other than that, it had everything I needed.Went and purchased another new model Samsung (also G2) from T-Mobile and the signal strength was the same.  I returned that new model.Tried out an LG GD570 and the signal was at least twice as strong and G3.  I'm going with the LG and will keep the T139 as a backup as it didn't cost much.  However, the LG has a tremendous amount of features that will keep you busy setting things up for days! It also works great with Microsoft Sync except no texting.
