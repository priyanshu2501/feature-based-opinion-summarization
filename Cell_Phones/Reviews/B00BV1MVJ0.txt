This is the first negative posting i have ever put on Amazon. Bought this phone for my wife for Christmas. In the first day we discovered problems charging the phone, even using the charger that came with the phone. 2) the headphone icon kept randomly appearing, removing all sound from the regular speakers. (no headphone was ever plugged in, by the way) 3) It's the unlocked International version, so why were the booklets writen in Arabic? In fact, the warranty is only valid in Saudi Arabia... what am i supposed to do with that? Bought this as a xmas gift for my wife and it is so disappointing. Wife & I previously used BB, HTC & IPhone, never had this crap. I have opted to return this item, awaiting the seller's feedback. I hope they do the right thing...

I love the samsung phones, this time I am replacing the white S3 buy for me Facino vary and are very practical and works

I received the wrong product sent me a cell phone 8 gb and 16 gb is sold as a robbery in the product description clearly states that it is a cell of 416 GB AND IS NOT SO! I hope my money back, they sent me the wrong phone only 8gb and it said it was 16 gb seems a theft and a scam, I will report on amazon I will not let you steal deceived me.

Got this from At&t; on Saturday and loved every moment of it.I've tried Droids and iPhone 5 (not 5S yet) and they simply weren't as good as S4. This is the phone that makes all others looks like jokes. The productivity enabling aspect of this phone is unbelievable.  The ability to get things done in a more simplified manner is just simply amazing.If you're looking for a quality, fast, upscale phone, this is the one.

I love this phone. It is easy to use, user friendly, sleek and I have better reception and only my phone changed not my carrier. I spent months deciding between this and the iphone 5 but couldn't bring myself to get an iphone just because its an iphone. I'm glad I did my homework, as a CranioSacral Therapist and author of Coming Through the Fog I need to have easy fast reliable access, my Galaxy SIV makes that happen.Coming Through the Fog: A mother shares her journey of her daughter's recovery from Autism and Sensory Processing Disorder to Functioning Recovery and ... providing helpful tips for other parents.

The phone feels great in hand and doesn't feel as much like cheap plastic as the S & S2. It has an impressive list of hardware specs easily making its way in the top 3. If you saw the release for this device you'll notice how Samsung didn't bring up anything about the hardware components (other than the Super AMOLED screen) and that's because they spent so much time displaying the software that comes on the phone. The phone has some pretty cool tricks but when it comes down to it they are just that, parlor tricks to show off to your friends or family. Granted they are pretty neat in reality most of us aren't going to use the software from day to day.Personally I have had some issues with the phone losing 3g service/wifi and have had to cycle it in airplane mode to make the phone reconnect but its just a minor issue that can easily be dealt with. After a base-band update (which may be needed out of the box) the call quality is wonderful. This phone is quick to load apps and home screen transition is smooth. It was a bit odd getting used to the home button coming from an S2 but I adapted quickly and Id have to say i like it better. Battery life for me is about 8-10 hours a day from what I consider mild usage (75% of that time I'm on 3g)  My biggest issue with this phone is the camera. When you cram so many pixels into such a small space it limits the amount of  light each pixel can take in therefore making the camera horrible in low light condition so pictures look a bit grainy. Most of our current tech can only display about 6 megapixel natively so the only true difference between a good 8MP and the 13MP on this phone are only noticeable during high zoom or if printing at huge sizes.Anyone purchasing this phone for use on an MVNO keep in mind that you will need a sim card for 3g service to work properly (yes this applies to CDMA phones as well)At the current date of this review this phones bootloader is locked (Unlocked for some carriers so check before buying) therefore no custom roms are available unless using an app called safestrap (in which selection is very limited)

one of the best thing in the world is to have this phone.... the best phone that i had have

S4 is fragile and cheap.....and Samsung knows it.Here is my story. Shortly after the S4 was released I decided to give android a shot. I had been a loyal IPhone customer, but the big beautiful screen was enough for me to take a gamble, and now I am paying for it.After about 1 month of use, somehow the phone developed an internal crack on the LCD. The phone had never been dropped, never had my 7 year old and my 3 year old play with it (side note: all of my IPhone have been thoroughly slobber/drop/sat on/thrown down stairs tested). There is no reasonable explanation for the internal, not external, screen to crack. But there it was, a tiny crack in the top right of the screen.Distressed I immediately ran to the store I bought the phone from. The girl at the store proceeds to tell me they see this ALL THE TIME. That she has seen someone that, while removing the 4S from the case, somehow managed to crack the internal LCD, just by removing it from the case. Basically that you just always have to be really careful and never put any kind of pressure anywhere on the phone. Wow, something that most people keep in their pocket and the store is telling me you can't ever put any pressure on the phone. She then tells me that she can't help me because even though it's an internal crack, they will still claim that it is damage and it won't be covered under warranty.I moved on to Samsung. After having the store switch my phone account back to my IPhone 4s, slobber, and everything, I called Samsung. I explained my problem to the girl and she said she can't help me, but that she would have someone call me back within 24 hours........25 hours later I called Samsung back. Needless to say I was annoyed. That fact that Samsung didn't even bother calling me back made me think they must be having major issues with their phones.  I asked the girl about this and she simply apologized, but couldn't explain why I hadn't been called back.  I again explained my situation to the girl on the phone. Her name was Octavia. Octavia explained to me that if the problem was in fact internal then Samsung would fix it for free. I was ecstatic. She emailed me a shipping label to send my phone in. (The email had the wrong address...sigh...I called back and talked to someone else, and he sent me the correct address.)I immediately sent the phone off to be fixed by Samsung.  After over a week Samsung calls me back to tell me that they can fix it, but it will cost me $200.00. I asked what they found and they said the LCD was broken. I asked so the "internal" LCD. They said yes. I asked about what Octavia had said about fixing any internal problems for free, they said that doesn't include the LCD............so basically. I told that guy he needed to find someone to explain how I go from anything internal will be fixed for free to now that we have your phone and have wasted over a week; we want to charge you another 200.00 for your plastic phone.I am currently waiting for someone else from Samsung to call me back. I am going to go out on a limb and say I am going to have to call them back. The bottom line is that the S4 is a terribly plastic design. Maybe the active is better, but I am thinking they probably made the active once they realized how incredibly fragile their standard design was.Avoid the S4 at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In retrospect, I should have chose the i9505 version, since apparently Samsung doesn't allow you to register an i9500.  but all things considered, it does exactly what I need, when I need it.

I had a bad experience with my Samsung SIII when the display went completely dead on Thanksgiving Day.  After shelling out a small fortune for a replacement - I need my phone for my job - I sent my SIII in for repair as directed by Samsung customer service.  I was told that it was under warrantee and would be a covered expense.  Surprise!  Now they want $150 for the repair.  Due to a broken Samsung product and very poor Samsung customer 'service,' I will not be purchasing any more Samsung products in the future.

The quality of this phone was above my expectations. I'm accustomed to an s3 and I was stunned by the quality of the display. It's so good that it looks fake. I'd recommend this phone to anyone who wants the best phone in the world.

It is a very great phone. But like all phones they all have their set backs. The phone is very versatile and can be used for almost any taste. You have more freedom with your app selection and also a much friendlier operating system then any Apple product that I have previously owned.Also you have a much better computer interface. When you connect to your computer you have a much better selection to select your picture, music, and apps. However, The price is a bit undesirable, short battery life, and slids out of your hand very easily without a case.

Didn't know when I bought the phone that it would not be able to connect to LTE network.  Everything else works as it should.

Great Phone I was using I phone and got bored by all restrictions they have to synchronize with computers very very happy with S4 specially the camera and touch free screenI will recommend to anyone compare to phone

NICE , I RECEVE ALL OK THANK , IN THE BOX I USE IN BRAZIL WORK WELL SAO PAULOT

After 30 days this "international" version is NOT COVERED BY SAMSUNG WORLDWIDE.Use it as paper weight - though it's made of plastic.

I received the phone but y didn't test it. I hope to use it during next month. Perhapas next time I could tell you

awesome phone...iphone has nothing on my samsung galaxy S4...hoot hoot, i would recommend this phone any day. its a must have......

I've done a *ton* of reading on phones and had narrowed it down to the S4, the HTC One, and the iPhone 5.I wanted to comment on a few things you don't read in reviews. My two big worries about the device after pre-purchase research were: the ugly exterior and TouchWiz.Regarding the exterior, personally, I think the HTC One looks the most attractive, but after you put a case on it, they all look roughly the same. Secondly, I actually prefer the feather light weight of the plastic S4 over the prettier but heavier premium metal finishes.Regarding TouchWiz: I was worried it would slow the phone down, and that definitely is not a problem. This phone is *extremely* responsive and fast. Obviously, the speed is due to the internal hardware not the skin, but the TouchWiz skin isn't getting in the way. Also, TouchWiz has a variety of minor additions that are more practical than the stock Android counterparts. I didn't expect that. For example, I like the TouchWiz keyboard and dialer and incoming call GUI better the alternatives. They let me do what I want to do more easily. The one big downside of TouchWiz is that much of it is cosmetically ugly. Stock Android and iOS both have a much cleaner/elegant look to them.Two other plusses: the LTE reception seems to work *way* better than my last Evo 4G LTE phone did. And, while on my home WiFi, my S4 streams YouTube with much less buffering than my Nexus 7 tablet, which surprised me because I would have thought that was strictly a network issue.Also, the camera, and specs, and feature list is quite amazing, and you can read about that stuff everywhere.Bottom line: this is the happiest I've been with a new phone.

I love Samsung galaxy s4. I have this phone for about 2 months and I still learning new things. I really recommend Samsung s4.

To start I paid extra for 2 day shipping that ended up being over a week.  After receiving the phone ( via US Postal service) it did not work.  only way to communicate was via online through amazon.  after support made comments that i did not know the difference in sim card and memory card i was told i had to call and talk to service tech.  Since they are only available during 9-5 hours It took me 2 days to reach someone who told me all that was needed was to send the phone back and a new one would be sent.I sent back the phone and tracking showed it was received.  I had to ask what they were gonna do to resolve the issue because i wanted the phone.  After 2 days of having the phone they waited till a friday to tell me it would be shipped on monday and would have by wednesday.  tuesday  i checked the tracking # and it was still only just created.Thursday afternoon i received a phone that worked.I would say that if the time to get a working phone was the first time and not a total of 3 weeks it would have been better.I like the phone now that I have it.

Love it, but only one complain, The phone language is set to Chinese or Japanese. I had to search the net to change it which was a bit difficult.

Couldnt even turn &iacute;t on. Try with another new battery and didn't work. I spend a lot for a broken phone.

I bought the Samsung Galaxy S4, coming from a Windows Phone 7 and then a Windows Phone 8 device.While the display is simply fantastic and the camera is also awesome, i feel that app startup time and loading times are just not as smooth as my previous devices...Overall i am fairly satisfied.

this phone is a piece of crap and the phone should be recalled the screen cracked so easy DONT BUT DONT BUY

Great item did not regret getting..! Just like the sore purchased ones except a lot more cheap...! great item A+++

I bought this product and I return it because it is not a real galaxy s4. it is clone of galaxy s4. I recommend to not to buy it,

It's a solid phone.As with previous devices, there are issues with sound and vibration that are way too complicated.E.g. you can not turn off the shutter sound for the camera which is really loud at least in my version without muting the entire phone.Apparently there were some patent issues.So when you want to take a quick picture of something, be prepared to sometimes accidentally alert the whole room with a loud click.Also, the phone while on silent likes to vibrate even when it is turned off. Not great if you're trying to be silent because the vibration itself is actually pretty loud especially if you keep the phone on a hard surface.Other than that, haven't had any issues. It has a pretty huge display which is nice for apps and games, not actually necessary for a phone per se of course. The battery will mostly last a whole day (had phone for 3 months now) unless you're really using it a lot during the day, videos and games and such.I would give it four stars or even five if they managed to get the sound issues simplified. Also the volume is sometimes way too loud even on the lowest setting. It just seems like it would have been so easy to just put a little more care into the device, especially since it's already the fourth version. Hope they will do even better in the future.

DO NOT buy a GT-i9500 model Galaxy S4...it is not for use in the USA and the model number and IEMI number won't even load into Samsung's US warranty claim page.  Luckily, I bought an extended warranty on the phone and was able to have it repaired. no cost.  Samsung should prohibit these phones from being sold in the US or at least honor a warranty.

Im extremely unhappy. First of all the delivery wasnt to my house I had to go to the post office to get it. Once I got my package I open it and I look at the screen thinking It has plastic over it protecting the screen. turns out the phone has internal water damage and I cant do anything.Photo link [...]

I made a video on this device, watch it here:[...]It is a really nice device, better than the iPhone, software and design wise.  But it is a plastic device.

A lot of thing already was said about this great Samsung product. All function you heard about work. It's a good acquisition.

Best phone ever I owned, i'm using it for few months now no problem what so ever, its every thing you need and you expect from Samsung never failed on me I have same phone carrier as my family this phone have 4 to 5 bar in the same spot witch other have no bar or 1 bar only

I like the phone but I don't like that games are pre loaded and I can't uninstall them. The camera doesn't have panoramic option.  Since I had the S3 previously,  I am familiar with Galaxy, and that's why I chose the  S4.

Samsung S4 is an awesome phone and this one arrived overnight as promised, brand new in box. It is unlocked as advertised and I love it.

It's an excellent phone, I wanted this phone years ago when Samsung launched S3. I had a blackberry phone and I though it was the best phone but now I have S4 I don't want to change my phone anymore.

While I was taking photo and recording video, I realised that there was a black spot on the screen.The problem was about lenses( in my opinion). Whatever there shouldnt have been this kind of problem because I paid 634 dolars. They refunded my money. They answered all my questions They tried to help me. I liked that.

This product was not genuine and it was refused to be refunded. It is a vulgar chinese imitation. Please, be careful when buying a product like this one. In addition it did not bring either head phones or genuine charger.

I was an iPhone user and wanted to see if the S4 was a good phone as a back up.  well 4 days of using it and the battery failed.  That is when I found out that Samsung has about 2 different versions of the S4 the international version doesn't just mean its unlocked it means no 4g and 3g is very very slow.  The website doesn't say it has 4g(so that was my fault). The phone also will not be updated to 4.4.2(KitKat) due to the fact that the phone company mine was built for is in Peru and now that the S5 is coming out they will only support it(spoke with them). While the company never misled me it definitely did not say this version works well in the US.  The battery life is horrible.  The only good thing is the camera.  As long as I will keep replacing the battery it may last me until the new iPhone comes out(Aug-Sept maybe later).  It may not be Samsung fault that I bought this but it is there fault for actually building this phone and putting it on the market.

i found out that the phone that they sold to me is not a genuine s4.Some of the settings is missing thats why i went to ask help and they found out that the phone is not genuine that's why some of the settings is missing...and one more the phone is lighter than the original one.I want to return it but i don't have time coz im out of the country.

I buyed the samsung galaxy S4 i9500 how said in the publication, and they send me a samsung galaxy S4 i9505 the product it's no the same.

Everything that I wanted was found on this phone.At first it was a difficult decision to leave my iPhone, but it was totally worth it!Hope you guys feel the same if you buy this amazing phone.

the charger was for europe not for america and now i have to bay an aadapter for the mobile ...

I can't attest to how great the phone is as I am an iPhone owner, but every time I speak to the two persons who received it they simply love it.  Being unlocked it helped them switch a SIM card with ease.

Excellent phone with outstanding battery life.I'm always watching a video, playing a game or chatting, and at the end of the day the battery is still alive with 30 or 20% left.

It was pointless to buy a phone and when you go to the Samsung site they only cater to persons living in the USA

The phone came with additional accessories.  I was thrill that I didn't have to buy a case or extra battery.  Only drawback is a lot of apps are in chinese and cannot be removed

Loved my Samsung S4 Works perfectly i think its for sure the best cellphone ever! i will buy from you guys for sure

This phone is an amazing phone. Hands down it is one of the best phones on the market.I have seen a few ratings saying this is fake. And from what I see, it is legit. It has all the Samsung Apps, it has the specs, and it has the right version of Android.When looking at this phone, I thought the screen may be to big. But after using it, I have no problem reaching all points of the screen.The camera on the phone is pretty good. It takes great photos and videos.I would recommend this to really anyone. I dont see much faults in the phone. It is easy to use, and very customizable. Overall, I think this phone is a great buy and I would recommend this phone over the IPhone 5s.

My camera settings came with defect, every control was upside down, the Gravity Sensor did not work properly and the battery was very short life duration.

The Galaxy S IV came in it's original box BRAND NEW!It included all the little manual books & head phones!Great service! :)

far better than iphone, cheaper too, lighter , excellent camera, easy to navigate , typing is easier , great wifi connection, sleek

The phone has screen smearing.  Apparently it is common,  but people  don't really  notice it at first.  Contacted Samsung and was told I would have to pay for them to fix even though it came defected. Phone is overhyped and for paying so much for it you would think it would be of better quality.

Best phone ever. The size, screen video quality and speed are what makes this phone the best Samsung ever made to date.

The phone is espetacular, beautiful, fast, and very very slim, but i wish it had better materials, the plastic cover on the back scratches very easy

Good morning, the product was not expected since the device is the imitation of the apparatus promoted on amazon, and the negatively qualify qa I think this seller is a scammer. Do not recommend at all. They should not allow you to sell more hereby touted as misleading offers.

Offers a product which is not the original send a Chinese product which has problems on the audio screen and others; I rate this as a negative way as it tries to scam customers seeking an original product.

First time android user, before I was a blackberry fan and I also have an Ipad but now I guest I'll stay with the  Android OS, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is every thing I expected and more. Great phone.

With the Galaxy S4, Samsung clinches its goal of global smartphone domination. The supercharged Android 4.2 Jelly Bean device may look like a toy compared with the stunning HTC One and the dapper iPhone 5 . But taken together, its blazing quad-core processor, colorful 5-inch HD screen, sharp-shooting 13-megapixel camera, and mile-high stack of software extras make the Galaxy S4 the most powerful super phone anywhere in the world.What does the Galaxy S4 have? A better question is: what doesn't it have? There's the 1080p screen, zippy processing speeds that are ideal for gaming , and an IR blaster that can control your TV. Then there's the parade of camera tricks that cram action shots into one scene, use both front and back cameras, and film a video in slow-mo. The GS4 can harness your eyeballs to pause video, and it can answer a phone call with the wave of your hand. Unlike the HTC One and the iPhone 5, it also piles on expandable storage space and a removable battery.It's true: most of the GS4's featurettes aren't essential -- and some aren't even very useful, like the camera's Eraser mode, which I never got to work, a sub par optical reader, and a translation tool that just duplicates what Google Translate already does. While none stands out as a must-have, cannot-possibly-live-without extra, these features do add up to a compelling testament that the Galaxy S4 is more than a step ahead of the pack.So, if you want a lovingly crafted statement phone that barely strays from Android's core offering, then buy the HTC One, which also has double the internal storage for about the same price. But if you're looking for a super phone that surpasses all other handsets on the features front, then you'll find in this deserving all-around flagship a strong mix of extremely competent hardware and inspirational software with very few major drawbacks.The GoodThe Samsung Galaxy S4 has Android 4.2.2, a fantastic camera, a powerful quad-core processor, and software solutions for just about every scenario -- including working as a TV/DVR remote. It's also comfortable in hand and has NFC, a user-replaceable battery, and a microSD storage slot.The BadIts screen is dimmer than competitors', its plastic design gives it a cheaper look than its rivals, and we found the Galaxy S4's power button turned on at undesirable times. Not all camera modes work as promised, and a long list of software features can quickly overwhelm and confuse.The Bottom LineIts laundry list of features require time and effort to truly master, but the Galaxy S4 is the top choice for anyone looking for a big-screen, do-everything smartphone.

exelente equipo

I find it quite unbelievable that anyone finds this phone useful. It does have a nice display but the fact that it can't run a single app is beyond my comprehension. I went back to the Motorola RAZR phone because it actually works. Samsung also has an overheating issue with its processor. This phone is supposed to be a quad core but it's the slowest of the slow when it comes to pulling up your pictures or trying to play music. It's a mess. It's a disgrace to the cell phone industry. NEVER AGAIN !!!

I chose this rating cause phone had a lot of defectiveApplication does not run smooth keep frogen all the timeAlso phone keep reset by itselfI would not recommend this phone to anyone

I've used an iPhone for over 5 years. In 2013 I was lucky enough to review the Samsung Galaxy S4 for Samsung. I loved the screen size of this phone. The display was really amazing. When using the camera itself everything was came out really sharp for the photos. I loved the dual camera. I was able to see myself when filming something else. The battery lasted the whole day for me for what i needed to do. I would recommend this phone to one of my friends. You can see more on my youtube channel: Youtube.com/TinyTechReview

With less than 6 months the phone stopped working because of a problem in the SIMCARD slot. Since I don't live in the US and Samsung warranty is not Worldwide, it is now just an iPod clone for the kids.Apple is expensive but has quality and worldwide warranty, Samsung is less expensive but lacks quality and worldwide warranty.... think about it... cheap stuff is just cheap because you'll need to buy 2...

I bought this phone for the gesturing and eye-tracking. Both are difficult to use, and cut my battery life in half. I tried to impress my friends with the hand/eye features, but just ended up looking dumb when I couldn't get them to work consistently.Maybe it takes practice, I don't know.My phone stayed hot too. (even when idle) I finally had to disable them or else keep charging my phone twice a day.Why would I buy a phone for features I can't even use?Some other observations.The screen is awesome!The call quality is good.The camera is good, but not great.The phone is VERY light.The battery life is normal with all the bells and whistles turned off.The phone has the same glitchy-ness found in all Android phones. In fact, I've had to restart it three times in the four days I've had it just for setting changes to show up. I also had one lock up.I bought mine directly from VERIZON, but they won't accept my review despite re-writing it several times. (maybe because it's not 5 stars)Don't get me wrong, it's a nice phone, but I can't use the things I bought it for!I wanted to like this phone so bad, but I find myself just disappointed.

I bought this phone as an upgrade to my S2. At first... it was buggy with camera crashes and a flickering issue but the good folks at Samsung recently fixed those issues with an update and the phone is much better now. Multi-tasking is of course a breeze and with the new update, you're able to send apps to the SD card. I love all the quirky features... especially air view and voice command. Awesome phone for the l337 and the n00b. Also, protect your investment and get a nice sturdy case. Gorilla glass is awesome but the phone is very thin so it can't absorb drops on the edges/corners.  Would hate for you to find that out the hard way.

Phone awesome but unlocked for US simcard only (not unlocked for world wide).I have to spend money again to unlocked the phone to use in Indonesia.Really disappointed

for some reason my phone doesnt have any water damage indicators, all the stickers are taken off! Now after only 6 months of use its sooo glitchy!!! It turns off by itself, or the screen just shuts off, now it doesnt even turn on.

As most of you know, the Galaxy s4 was one of the most anticipated smartphones of 2013. With that said, my expectations were very high for this product to the point where I decided to buy it on the same week it launched. Before I start the review, please keep in mind that I consider myself an average user who spends most of the time "hands on" doing tasks at work, or simply painting or doing graphics - in other words, I will most likely look at my phone every other hours, unless I receive a text or a phone call.Pros:- Beautiful 5in Screen. One of the best screens out there. Rich blacks and HD video playback.- Great 13MP camera! I usually take a lot of pictures when I'm outdoors, so its great to have a 13 MP stock camera in my pocket.- Expandable memory (Very useful when keeping a lot of pictures)Cons:- Phone calls tend to be not clear- Pre-loaded apps are very annoying and update every time you have wifi on (almost 3 times a month)Alright, alright. I know what you guys are thinking. "That's not even 10% of the good content that the phone has to offer."Multi-window, Air view, Android market, S beam, Air Gesture, NFC, Smart Scroll, Smart Stay etc... To be honest, I only took a look at those the first day that I got the phone. It's a great addition, but most of them are useless when you have a steady schedule. Half of what they included is not for daily use, and it seems that it was mostly targeted for individuals who have time to actually use them. For me, I tend to use things that are straight to the point. The air gesture looks great, but half of the time I am eating, I wouldn't have my hands dirty like the guy in the commercial had to answer the call, lol! I gotta give it to them though, the screen is amazing! better than the iphone 5. Great for movies, but... when I want to watch a movie, I would rather watch it on my 55" HDTV. I mean, in all seriousness, I personally think this phone is great. The specs are fantastic, but if you are like me who only needs a phone to answer calls or send messages or scroll to pictures (that usually have a thumbnail/ no need for airview), then almost 80% of all the new content that the s4 has to offer is not really for daily use. But then again, that's just my personality. I had an Iphone 5 before the s4 and after a month of having the s4, I'm already heading to the ATT store for a nano sim card for my Iphone 5 as it fits my basic needs. I'm not an apple fanboy, and I actually own other Samsung products as well as the S4, but it's just not for me!I'm giving this phone a 5 stars because it is a great phone for those who have the time to use it correctly. I won't be bias because personality varies from person to person. Cheers! :)

I love this phone but it's a little bit expensive. The screen is really big, I think I need some time to adjust to it.

And comparison of real samsung galaxy s4,  I fell that this is not very good.The system cannot update.  I will change a new one.

No star for the product. very shody product. does not deserve a single star but i just gave him one star because i m required to.

I would like to know in case the phone says it is 16gb when in fact the phone is 8GB or want an explanation is that this article is an imitation. I feel cheated can not deny that the cell came in good condition and that new but that is not the box says 16gb if I want a quick response

Dear Sirs:It is one of the best smartphones ever!!!. Real Value for money!!! Very good performance Aand also a friendly device.

Love it so much! The phone is smooth and easy to use, battery life is more than decent, and the screen is big which fits to my liking.

I will buy another phone here! Sorry for didn't write a review so long. But this phone is really worth buying. I like it ! Thanks !

I am one of a few select few people that can honestly say I currently own the Iphone 5 and Samsung S4. My company phone is the Iphone 5 and my personal is the S4. My thoughts on Apple are, they were the innovators of the smartphone and Tablet world. But now with that birth, we are at a maturing age within the industry, and fact is, Iphone cant just stick with what got them to the top, since phones like the Samsung S4 are the latest and greatest smartphones that leave Iphone in the dust.My points will be simple and straight forward. Im not a tech junkie, both phones perform well as far as software speed, though S4 takes the cake. Most of the points below refer to the user friendliness of the phone.1. Both are great phones, fast, seamless, beautiful screens, awesome video/pics2. S4 takes the cake with its screen, which is way bigger, and way easier to read articles, watch videos.3. People think initially that the S4 too big, well its really not since the phone itself is so thin, it fits easily into my pocket without feeling bulky or awkward. this may bother some people worried about durability, well I guess just get a good case.4. Keyboard, again way way better on the S4. All the keys I need are on one screen. With the iphone I need to go to another screen to access... commas, ?, !, numbers, @, or .com to name a few. I find that so annoying when writing emails and texts which I frequently do on my phone. S4 allows access to all on one screen5. Video and Pics, are a tie as far as quality, I mean you have to be really picky to pick one over the other....but seeing my pics on a 5 inch screen is a lot better than viewing them on a 4 inch screen. Video watching also way better on a 5 inch screen.There will be Apple fans and Droid fans, but for the people in between that just want the best phone on the market with all the bias BS thrown out...S4 takes the cake until Iphone changes their hardware to keep up. Iphone cant stick with what got them to the top, they need to continue to innovate or they'll get left behind.Iphone 5 is a good phone, it just that S4 is an awesome phone

This product is a duplicate from the real one. Is made in korea, the box and te accesories look fine but the back case from the inside looks cheap.. great phone but is a duplicate!Try to expend $50 mores and buy the real one

It was an excellent purchase. The device works perfectly and the service was also excellent! Congratulations to Open Group Wireless for the perfect service that they've done.

The cellphone irrived in time and i need only check my self because it irrived in my crew work in usa and soon he will return as per normal but thanks for the staff meet the required spectetion .

This is a great buy. i am so happy and loving it. Thank you. keep up the great customer service and good quality products.

Light, comfortable to hold, touch screen works perfectly. I like pre installed apps S Memo and S Health, like the sound. Still inspecting the device.

It did the job for me during my recent oversea trip. However, the 4G network might not be available in some areas in a foreign country. So keep that in mind.

Typical Crappy plastic samsung phone. The software lags (home button ) and freezes all the time. The battery is not up to par with other smartphones... Its got WIFI problems , only 8gb of user accessible storage,smudging when scrolling and i can go on and on... Its just been a horrible experience for me. Never buying samsung again...

Samsung Galaxy S IV/S4 GT-I9500 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (White), i recommend it, an amazing Smartphone, maybe a Little big but a real complete cellphone.

One reason it is not 5 stars is lack of hard drive spaceneeded to be at least 32gbbut despite this i still have all the apps i needand pics and video can go on sd cardgames however need to be carefully selected 2 big games at most at any point of time then i will have to delete one to have room for new onehopefully android and samsung will let us transfer this big apps and games to sd cardother than that phone is as great as the hype and worth the price

Hey everybody. I`m from brasil and thinking about buying this phone, but i`m a little worried it may doesn`t work here in Brasil. Do you guys know if it really works? I`m asking cause a friend of mine just bought a phone in USA and it  doesn`t work at all, and its really difficult here to unblock (I know this one is already unblocked but in Brasil this "kind" of "unblocked" doesn`t work).Thanks!

Phone was in great shape, just as expected but it wasn't charging. If it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.

This product is not the authentic Samsung Galaxy S4. I watched a video comparing an authentic S4 and a fake one. From what I learned in the video, this is the fake one. It described all of the characteristics of a fake one compared with a real one, including looks. This one has a lot of flaws. Based on the reviews, it breaks easily and always resets itself, unlike the real one. People shoudln't buy expensive items from the internet. Nobody can trust the sellers of the items. And also, it says that this phone is only an ACCESSORY!

I love the phone it works as described, i have not had any issues and the fact that it is unlocked makes it fun. I recommend it anyone who interested in a good reliable smartphone

Excellent, thanks!!!

Best of all piece of hardware i have own so far. Recommended if you  are looking for cell set to buy

great phone , does what it suppose to will definitely purchase again i don't regret one bit.  definitely  recommended product

I'm coming from a Galaxy S2, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S3, and now currently own the S4.The S4 is the by far the best phone to date. I'll admit that it isn't a mind blowing huge update from the S3, but there are definite improvements.The screen has just fantastic clarity, and overall the phone fits much better in my hand than the S3. Battery life is far superior to the S3 and previous phones. I really appreciate the fact that I can make it through 15 hour day, use 4 hours of on-screen time, and still manage to have 30% remaining. Never have I gotten such great battery life out of an Android device. I dont use many of the new samsung software features, however some people might. Most will find the new software features gimmicky.Expandable storage is another great feature and one that I look for in all of my phones. One can use up to a 64GB microSD card to store music and pictures or whatever else. Another consideration one should look at before purchasing this device that is 16 or 32 GB of memory is required for app storage. Apps are unable to be stored on the microSD card, and the Android operating system and Samsung software eat up a considerable amount of the base 16 or 32GB phone models.The camera on the S4 is fantastic. I am just floored sometimes at the level of detain in my pictures. Images come out looking just fantastic, and this camera also takes some of the best low light pictures I have seen.I added a Ringke SLIM case for a minimal protection and look. Overall I am very pleased with the S4 and happy that I upgraded from the S3.

Just ran the Genuine Galaxy S4 app and it reports that #1 it has the wrong rom size and #2 it has the wrong screen resolution to be a genuine G4.  My unit also has did not have a valid serial number and would not register on my US network.  But my real unlocked will do so.Greg

Well, company offered a good shipping service, it arrived on time, and best of all it is really totally unlocked, this not surprises I found while introducing two different carriers SIM cards, Wonderful

A fantastic phone!  It came in exactly as ordered and it rocks! If have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.

Samsung Galaxy S4 is very good.Camera, display, etc. ..All like it.And I want to recommend to anyone else.Good products.

its pretty good....I bought this one cuz I want to use the same phone  with my mum.so if there is any problem with my mum's phone, I can help her and teach her how to use such a smart phone....miss my mum...

very good telephone, light, high resolution, big screen. work excelent, very fast.It's a pitty that the special samsung application did not work in Israel

When I first open the device, I have seen freeze issues but in 5 mins, device recieved an update and it solved freezing completely.Positives;Wifi reception is very good.Very lightweight, very thin.Plastic quality is good. Actually there is a aluminium frame between front and back covers.Benchmark performance from antutu is over 28k.There are lots of program, widgets coming with it. I think these are just bloatwares.Speaker is very loudy if you care.Hand grip is very good, even better than S3.There is a thin jelatin on the camera. this is for you who thinks camera can be damaged due to its design.1 more thing; It is not a US model but sender or distributor included a US adapter to the package.I didn't see anything bad. You may want get aluminium back cover since openinin-closing cycle will definitely damage connecting tabs. droppign will not be fatal because of aluminium frame.Edit: After using it for couple of months camera glass was broken as I was concerned above. One thing about performance; Samsung doesn't seem to handle octa core design very well. I see some performance issues in some apps which I don't see any issue with snapdragon quad core in my Padfone2. About connectivity, It works with HSDP+ of USA Tmobile If you care.Edit#2: I saw too many comments regarding fake/authentic S4 so I checked my phone which I bought from here with genuine samsung app. It is genuine S4.

I like this perfect prices or below than this prices. Go samsung! Let beat iPhone and be a good android.

I bought it brand new and in about three weeks it started to freeze and cant respond when l recieve a call. I blame it on the seller because l tried to return it only to find that l cannot return it since the return date expired. Overall its a gud phone l like it just that l dont know what could be the problem fir it to start freezing.

The phone only allows you to record 2 second videos smh I was really disappointed and very difficult to figure out. Unlike the regular s4 samsung galaxy it let's you record 2mins and very simple to use.

Hello every one, this is an encredible phone I recomend it I'm Android user few years ago was a apple fan with this I'm giving my personal oppinion and my NEUTRAL comment. the both os droid and ios are great. but since i have an android i prefer this because the you dont have to pay for apps. any way this cellphone is awesome the camera is super fine the HD display is great better than his little brother S3, super fast with octa core and 2gb ram Highly recomendedRegards from HONDURAS.

Phone is just OK ,I upgraded fro S2 and was not WOW`ed or anything .Screen is better but everything else is the same .Home button did broke after less than 3 months .After hours of spending on chat they mentioned they can RMA but : \" the TAT (Turn-around-Time) for the phone service is 2-business days to ship in the device + 5-7 business days for Service + 2- business days to ship out."So now i will be left out of phone for two weeks ..Now i got the WOW , in my face !would not buy samsung device again , over hyped , over priced , poor service

This phone is very easy to use. Its great for calling and texting. I love how it makes awesome pictures.

excelent

Better hope your touchscreen doesn't quit workingOurs did and we sent it back to Samsung to get fixed and they said it was water damaged however we never got it wet except for MO humidityOther than that it was good phone

love it

Its just the perfect gadget I needed all this while, its really the gadget for the future, I will highly recomend it

i have basically used all phone styles. i know samsung is an amazing company and i was truly expecting better stuff from the phone my last phone was the sg3 and even my phone advisor  told me the upgrade wasn't worth it, yet i did it. it was laggy and slow at times, waste of my money

I ordered a Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 Factory unlocked International Version (white), but I got one Galaxy S4 SGH-M919 that as far as I could find out is not an international version and exhibits different features. Therefore, this is not a good seller

Samsung Galaxy S IV/S4 GT-I9500 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (White)Waiting upon my return to the USA from China ,and then i will purchase 2 S4's for my wife and myself ,and the other items that is on my wish list ! Have had plenty of time,56 days,to research,and read other reviews from other people !All i know is that i will never buy another apple product,as my old i-pod is now junk,as it will not sync up with my new hard drive on my computer ! Do not want to be shackled to one industry product !I have a Google Nexus 7,so i will buy what i think is the best,for the money that i spend !Samsung Galaxy S IV/S4 GT-I9500 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (White)This is an update from my prior review of the Samsung S4 GT I9500 Factory Unlocked Phone -International Version ( White ) Wish list is complete from my purchases of these 2 phones,2 otter boxes, Anker 13000mah battery bank, with charger and all the other accessories that I wanted ! Everything arrived as described, and in good shape ! Used AT&T; for the micro sim card, and put 1200 prepaid minutes on each phone with small amount of data ! Minutes are good for one year !Do not do contracts, or monthly payments, so this phone is exactly what I wanted !Change to a prepaid sim card when we go back to China, as my wife can talk to all of her friends ! Still learning about this phone, as I am not an electronics person !

i like it a lot

fake phone pls do not waste 400$+ on this guy!i got the package everything looks great, real box with a charger and an extra battery. how do i know the phne is fake? well i received the phone and i went to the at&t; phone store. they could not work with it very well. the phone was very different than the one at the store. plus it did not have the same design on the back.... it did not say s4 .i can not belive  i got dooped on amazon. never buying a phone online ever again

the best cell phone ever not like any other phone.it is like computer in your hand. love it love it.

I found that the back shell can not clutch the phone well when I received it. Bad quality of SamSung! Not worthy of that high price!

I have ordered i9500 with 16GB, I have only one receive from our with only 8GB. Not recommended. The articles have been mislabeled pay much punishment for inches.

It is amazing... The seller is really truthworthy, the shipping and everything was good. I can't complain at all... The phone is an incredible tool... so many things i can do. Im really enjoying my purchase. Im very pleased

I love my phone since i have it on my hands. Love it I want the S5 now. lol .

the phone is OK but we ordered an international version and received a US locked version. Since We do not live in the States this caused a lot of inconvenienceThe phone is OK

This phone will never let you down. It does worth waiting.It's very light and thin with an amazing big screen. The sound, camera, touch and size are all far beyond expection. It makes your life easier and comfortable, definitely better than iphone, etc.

Thank you very good all..you are very good seller ;)....but i have one problem beacause you dont sent it me as a gift my greek CUSTOMS fees was 150$ :(

Whereas the Samsung Galaxy S4 I9505 is superior in terms of processors (1.9 instead of 1.6) and network flexibility (additionally to 2G and 3G (which both have), the I9505 also supports 4G/LTE (which is already working in many countries), AND often at the same price or even cheaper![...][...][...]see also: [...]

This phone is an awesome phone and works great.I would highly recommend this phone to anyone.This is such a great product and was shipped in a timely manner.

Be very careful the screen cracks way to easily. I had the phone in my shorts and must have bumped into something and when took my phone out the screen was cracked. I did not drop or sit on it. Gorilla glass 3 is a joke if walking and bumping into something cracks the screen. Mine is right at the home button. It is smashed there and the crack goes half way up the phone.

In six months, I tried iPhone5, blackberry bold, and then S4, this is by far the easiest to use, the most fun to use, and a beautiful piece of technology.

They shipped the product fast and the phone is of high quality the only minor thing is that the manuals are written in Arabic please do Something about that....but you can download a PDF from samsung on the manual at their official site 5 stars to the product seller

Is a good phone but when you spend an entire weeks paycheck on something claiming &#34;unlocked&#34;, after a month when it finally arrives it's beyond frustrating when you scan the numbers on the back to find is only unlocked on a network that's not the one you're locked into a contact with. Then costumer service was very poor at responding causing another month delay in attempting to use only to find out that is cheaper to pay the early termination fee than the restocking fee. 1star for phone, negative 10 stars for the vendor.

The items i received are cloned and replica samsung galaxy S4. the imei of the phones are different from written on their barcodes. The apperiance, the screen sensibility, the resolution of cameras and the other performance of the phones are weakness. The phones are not original. This is so depressing event that I ever saw. I want to take my money back.

So let me start by saying that I had been using the iPhone 4S prior to swithcing to the Galaxy S4 about 3 months ago.  For those who do not want to read the complete detailed review, you may skip to the last paragraph at the bottom for a summary.So after having this phone for about three months, I will say I love many of the features of this phone as well as of Android.  However, there are drawbacks.  The drawbacks you will notice are minor things but there are so many minor things that they eventually become a major thing in my opinion.Lets go item by item:Screen Size: Love the large display and the sharp screen.  Although I was hesitant about it at first, I have grown to love it.  But no, it isnt all good. The screen is too large to reach all corners with one hand.  This does not help when you are using the phone while driving but i guess ur not supposed to do that anyways so I cant complain.  Also, even though the phone is quite large in ur pocket, it isnt quite as large and annoying as i thought it was going to be - unless u wear skinny jeans i guess.  Now, when I look at other peoples iPhone's, I feel like how did i ever live with such a small screen.  Yes, it feels that small after using this for a little while.  Even though the large screen has its small drawbacks, I love it and idk if i would be able to go back to a small iPhone 4 size screen.Camera: Camera is amazing.  I love all the different options you have to pick what quality and size you want your pictures and videos to be so you can save space on your phone.  I love all the different modes the camera has and overall it takes very good pics.  I have mine set for 6MP so it takes less space and so i can message the pictures easier and the pictures come out great!  No con here excpet for the fact that there should be a way to open the camera without unlocking the phone like iPhone has it so if you want to take a picture of something right away you can.  I'm hoping Android adds that to a recent upgrade.Battery Life: Battery life is good but nothing great.  If i dont use it much throughout the day, I will have 30% or so still left by the end of the day.  If i use it alot, i might run out of charge by 6-7PM.  Moderate use, i usually am at 15% or so by 11PM and my day usually starts at around 730AM. The good thing is that when ur battery gets old and can barely hold a charge, u can simply get a replacement and switch it out which isnt as easy on the iPhone.SD car Slot:  Love it.  On my iPhone, i kept running out of space, granted i had the 16GB, but i love that you dont have to get the higher GB one for this phone and just expand the memory with SD card slot.  I put a 32GB one in mine and i put all my music and movies/videos and pictures on there.Headphones: Good in ear headphones. Stay in my ear at the gym.  Sound great. Cant complain.  I tested them against the new iPhone 5 headphones and they both pretty much sounds the same.  The iPhone headphones might be marginally better.Apps/Widgets: Plethora of apps.  Apps for everything.  So MANY FREE APPS! I also love widgets.  Something i was not farmiliar with with my iPhone but they are very helpful.Out of Box experience: HORRIBLE.  This phone comes with so much bloatware and is doing so much in the background that it was giving me anxiety.  There is all this unwanted samsung/google/At&t; software.  I wish the phone came with a clean version of android without all this other crap.  A few hours of messing around and customization, i have it exaclty how i want it.  But for someone that was new to Android, all the crap that came on here stressed me out.New Features:-Eye Scrolling thing: I tried it, it was annoying, and so i turned it off.  BTW it doesnt detect ur eye, you have to move ur head.  Who moves their head when reading a 5inch screen?!-Smart Pause: keeps pausing my video even when im looking at it.  Useless annoying i turned it off.-IR Blaster: This is pretty cool if i am very very lazy to get up and get my remote.  Tho i prefer my normal remote but its pretty cool.-SHealth: I thought I'd use it but I havent...didn't seem useful when I first tried it out but it may be so dont take my word for itOther Things I love:-I love you can dload music and torrents straight to this phone-I love the LED alert light for messages, I missed this feature when I left my Blackberry for my iPhone. U can also chose the color for different types of notifications-4G LTE is fast! Obv iPhone 5 has that too but i still thought id mention it.Little things that drive me crazy:-Speaker: Why is it on the back?! when u are listening to a video or something ur looking at the screen.  Why is this projecting the audio the other direction.  Very annoying.-Lock Screen button: When u go to press the lock button, u press against the other side also, but guess what's on the other side?! the volume buttons! so now u may have put ur phone on silent when u didnt want to or made ur phone loud right before work.  Or maybe u noticed but now u have to unlock ur screen and change the volume and lock ur screen again and make sure u dont accidentaly hit the volume key again.-Clock: you know how when u take ur phone out just to check the time for a split second and then put it back in ur pocket? Well guess what? there is a split second delay for your time to update so ur gonna have to take it out...wait a split second..look at the time...and put ur phone back..this needs to update faster.-Buttons: all the buttons have a cheap feel.  They dont have that bold (yes i pressed that MF button feeling) your always left wondering did i press that button? did that go through?-App Updates: I told my phone to only update apps on WIFI, but it does is on 4G also...wth stop!-Stuff: Stuff takes longer to do than on the iPhone.  It just does.  There are more options and more menus and more of everything.  Its the price u pay to be able to do more with ur phone i guess.-Emojis: My gf and I cannot communicate anymore.  We use Whatsapp because there are no emoji's on andorid except those crappy android only emojis which suck.Emergency Call: The emergency call option is right where ur thumb will hit it continuously when u go to unlock ur phone.  ANNOYING!-WIFI: it connects to random unsecured wifi networks around u without asking you..i dont like it...there are unsecured networks around my work that it will connect to but they dont have internet so ill have disable wifi so i can use my 4G and then when i get home i have to rememeber to turn my wifi on so i dont go over my 2GB data limit.-Email: I dont love the email on this phone..gets ur job done though-Saving Pictures: u know when u go on FB and u see a meme and u wanna save it...and if u have an iphone u can hold down the pictures and an option to save the picture will come up...well not here.  I think there is an app u can dload to do that but why should i have to dload an app for something so simple.  I just take a snapshot but then i have to crop out the sides and it takes from the quality of the picture as well.-Voicemail: why do i have to dload a visual voicemail app? why isnt it embedded in the phone? W/ESummary:I love this phone.  It has alot of cool features and things you can do that you cannot do with the iPhone.  Many of these features may just be Android though. It also has many drawbacks which tick me off.Would I make the Switch knowing what i know now? Yes, yes I would.  Although, I don't love it so much that I'd out rule the iPhone.  If Apple came out with an iPhone 6 with a bigger screen and some cool new features, I would consider switching back.  I love the build quality of the iPhone, something that the Galaxy simply does not have.  I also enjoy the ease of use on the iPhone, although, I hate that whole syncing with iTunes stuff (when i was trying to take my music off my iPhone so I could put it on my Galaxy it was, challenging, to say the least,  because i had to download a software which wasn't free to get my music off because Apple doesn't allow YOU to remove YOUR music that's on YOUR phone -_-)Hope you found this review helpful*UPDATE****After having this phone for almost a year, here is my update.  First off, why did Samsung delay Kit-kat to S4 users till just about a month ago.  It was very annoying that everyone was running kit-kat and I had Jelly-Bean. Secondly, along with the Kit-Kat update, Samsung decided to add more annoying apps that I didn't ask for. The phone also acts up quite a bit now and feels much slower.  Also, the plasticy quality of the phone is really getting to me. The trim scratches and peels way too easily.  Also, the battery life has significantly decreased since the update to Kit-Kat, it barely last me half a day now.  Also, as I have mentioned above, the power button on one side and the volume buttons on the other is a very stupid feature and so is the speaker on the back.  And i don't think they have fixed those on the S5 either.  Samsung needs to start listening to its customers and improve the things that most people complaining about such as the plastic etc.  Also, none of those cool features that Samsung advertises work well.  They are all useless.  Not to say there is nothing good about the phone.  Everything i mentioned above about the phone that i like is still there.  However, i have lowered my 4star to 3 star.  I am not going to upgrade to the S5. Going to, probably going to give the HTC One M8 a chance.

Love the s4 in every single way over the iphone. My battery life though, kind of sucks. I have everything turned off, wifi, gps, etc., power save mode on, etc., if I go to bed with under 40%, the phone is dead when I wake up.I've lost a number of iphones to my concrete floor in my office. The galaxy has dropped twice, and just has some scuffs.Other than the battery, extremely happy.

I have test this phone octacore, quad core [S4] and also comparison with Note 2, galaxy s3, Lg optimus G, Lg optimus G pro, LG 4x HD, Sony Xperia Z [None LTE], Nexus 4 and it came the best phone ever.Head to head and 3g advance with other 3gs phone version, the battery life much longer than any phone that I had. I love this one ...Cons: No LTE support for USA market .... otherwise ... it best of the best ...............!!!!

after 2 months the screen doesnt works and nobody take cares of the warranty, samsung says they dont have warranty for amazon phones, and amazon only gives 30 days, thats incredible that 630 dollars of a phone do not have any warranty like samsung, go to somewhere else to buy the phone with warranty

I ordered from  "Joycells" 2 brand new  Samsung Galaxy S IV/S4 GT-I9500 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version, but they both arrived in unsealed open boxes. When I asked seller why  the boxes were open, he replied that they needed to open the box to unlock the phone. But in the description of the phone it says clearly: " Factory Unlocked Phone". If the phone is factory unlocked why they need to unlock it again. I asked them this question several times but never received answer.They are selling used phones for the price of new ones. I contacted them 3 time through amazon Customer Service, and all 3 time they responded that they are willing to receive phone  back for 15% restocking fee but this is not mentioned anywhere on amazon. They did not send phone that I wanted and now want to get 15% restocking fee.

It didn't worked with both at&t and T-Mobile sim, Rest phone is good. Came in factory box with no issues

cell phone came to venezuela with a sistem failure and i have no warranty here in my country to repair it,  it's a shame the battery does not last long and the cell phone overheats without using it this is to bad :( because i cant return it and i cant use it

Bad seller. Supposed to be an international version yet came with wall plugs that were not European. Even the US one would not fit into the wall but only into the strange plug that wouldn't. I travel to the British Isles and all over Europe and the included plug fit none of those. When I complained tiwce to the seller, they did nothing, so had to eat another $40 to get plugs that would work. The only way to charge it was though a laptop, which is pretty ridiculous. Once charged, the phone worked fine, but if I were to to it again, I would find another seller.

Its a samsung, so you know what to expect. Great hardware wrapped in a chep feeling exterior.Is as responsive as Android's get, Aswome camera, new features are good but the exitement wares out quickiy whan you accept that you will never use them in real scenarios.

Works perfect!! I use it in France and in Latin America and I haven't had any problem at all.

The phone got to me on time as expected but plan to return it the camera does not work it keeps saying camera failure went online to resolve the problem did everything it said to do put the camera back in default and still not functioning.

I am not sure how this happen, but this company (Bavaro phones) is trying to sell fake phones for original price, and it's not right. I contacted the company, and will be returning the phone, I hope all goes well with me getting my money returned. I will think twice before I order another phone from Amazon, but all other products I have ordered has been great.

samsung galaxy s4 is made for me, i am a manager at key food, it keeps me updated with my events and the internet word with all the latest apps, by far the best smartphone in the market so far. very happy

it's been four months and still not reach the friend product, please I need my money, not recommend, I want my money

Great box and envelop!!! with all the batteries and everything you need to connect it.The only strange it, is that it even i order it for america, the software was for Brazil.

This phone is Amazing!, the camera of this phone is the best of all so far, the hardware performance is excellent, the software performance is very good (apple IOS wins for minimum), and the flexibility of the software and hardware is priceless.......And the Best is that is the authentic international version phone and includes spanish language factory

I did my research before I made the purchase and thus far it has lived up to all expectation; functional.

I had iPhone 4 and Blackberry curve before this Samsung. I love this one so much for many reasons. I  am not going to mention all pros.The screen is very clear and the camera is amazing. I love the features the camera has. the speakers and sounds are great. it's very easy and fun to use I can't stop using it. The app store or google play has everything. I found all the apps I needed.The only thing I did't like is that it shuts down with no reason, one time it restarted by itself (i guess from overusing the phone). Also, the battery life is not that great comparing to other phones.overall, I recommend this phone.

friendly person but decided not to buy the camera was not 8mp and 13mp. the product was not what I expected

easy to use, great pictures and lighter than IPhone !I bought the unlocked, international version, but unable to insert the SIM in Asia and use it. Had to pay someone to unlock it !

Great phone. Works perfectly in Venezuela. Loved it from the first second I got it. Highly recommend it. The only downs are that the battery doesn't last much and it is huge!

AA+++

I purchased this phone for my Mom as her birthday present at local store.  I thought &#34;International Version&#34; will have the language I want.  Sadly it didn't.  It only have Simplified Chinese which she doesn't speak, read or write.  Where is the Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong or Taiwan user gone!?  Battery running out fast and the phone surface is hot not comfort to touch.  Even worst it automatically unmount / remount the SD card, causing the phone to create a lot of junks files eating up the phone space and memory resource.  I talked to store sales about my problems, he recommands to trade it with an iPhone 5S which I did.  Thank God!  All my problems are gone, I got the language I want.  The system is stable and the phone up time is acceptable.  Thank you Samsung let me know iPhone 5S is much better that Galaxy S4, more human, more user friendly and have better hardware and software.

Even though I have been getting one glitch in 1 per 10-20 times I open the camera app, the phone freezes for a few seconds and out of nowhere it restarts the phone, I must say, I love this phone! I hope this is a problem of my phone only, because the phone is incredibly fast for everything as any phone should be. I kind of feel that we went backwards with "smartphones" that don't react to your finger sometimes, don't let you hang the call or just freeze all the time, in that case I even prefer a normal-old phone. With this, I feel like I have finally a Smartphone (Or maybe even more like a computer!).

Not much to comment on this fantastic phoneI wish that the battery lasts a little longer, is less than a full day

the best phone no matter who you are. great for hard core and newcomers.best camera , best screen, best battery, best processor, and the list keep on going

i am so excited to finally have the s4 after staying with the priginal s1 for so long.  it was delivered exactly on time (maybe even a little early) and it works beautifully.  i highly recommend the product and the seller

Really recommend the phone and the seller, the phone is just amazing, does anything you could expect a phone does. the phone got here 2/3 days after i bought it!

The cell is full has many functions, I recommend it, it's like having a laptop is very light. Really is released.

Only issue with this phone: dropped it from 3 inches out of my hand, had a huge crack across the entire screen. Love the phone but that is quite a design flaw, Samsung.Unfortunately, I cant get it fixed officially since it has no warranty so I went to get it unofficially repaired, even got a case for it to protect it from further drops. Soon as I put a case on it, it refuses to turn on, at all. A huge issue for people who put cases on their phones and bigger issue for people who don't have warranty to get it fixed/replaced.On the bright side, got the device from seller as expected and as advertised.

The phone works as it should with the exception of being compatible with AT&T; 4G LTE in the United States. 4G LTE was NOT listed as a feature, but I was expecting it anyway.My Internet access is limited to the slower &#34;H+&#34; speed of 3Mbps download and 1.5Mbps upload (1/3 the speed of the same phone on 4G LTE). This was a &#34;real world&#34; test at my home with two Samsung Galaxy s4 phones (one US vs. one International) next to each other.I'm sure many non-tech-savvy users wouldn't even notice. It's still a worthwhile purchase considering how much more expensive the same phone (but with 4G) is at the AT&T; store ($200 more at the time of this review).

The S4 from Samsung is one of the best smart phones now.This phone has an Exynos 5 octa chipset featuring a 1.6 Ghz Quadcore and a 1.2 Ghz Quadcore processor making web browsing fast.This phone has a Jelly Bean 4.2.2 OS along with a 13MP primary camera and a 2MP front camera.This phone has a 5 inch super AMOLED screen and and numerous features.This is a super phone which is very good and is very highly recommended.

I really need to read reviews before I got off buying things. I was nervous after I had already placed the order and then I started reading the reviews. Some of them are horrible and I sure as hell was not about to pay for a restocking fee for someone else's mistake, but all went well. Will I ever buy anything from this seller again? Hell no, I'm just glad everything went well this time but I'm not taking my chances with a seller that can manage to send a person the wrong color for a phone. But, your gamble.

This is the best cellphone ever! It's has a lot of features and all what you need to make simple your life. 100% recommended

This device will not be supported by Samsung in US. Also it doesn't work with most of service providers. Network keeps getting disconnected. I am returning my phone to amazon.

The phone is great and has awesome functionality. The phone claims to be unlocked - international version but the phone only works with an American SIM card.

I bought this a month ago and I didn't have any problem with the delivery or the conditions of the phone, everything works perfectly, Its camera features are the best, since i moved from a Nokia C3 to a Samsung Galaxy S4 i really am excited with all this new and modern features I was missing, the battery life is sometimes not the best but every new generation phone is like that, I fell in love with my phone I definitely recommend this phone

The phone I received is not working properly. When I open camera, phone restarts automatically and it is freezing frequently and need to restart everytime it freezes.

Great phone, all in excellent condition, I recommend it's amazing all that I can do with my new phone 100% recommended.

Hi John, I have many questions for you, I brought the phone you sold me to my country, and I could use, take to the center of Samsung and was told that is a reconstructed cell, I wonder what will happen with this? because you've lied about everything

That is the right item to fulfill my requirements it very important you get what you ordered. i will be able to refer my friends keep it

I am very happy the phone is better than i expected. I like it very much thank you so much

Really really i have doubt about this purchase because i saw in the past some friends buying bad or with deffects phone, but this Samsung was great. I recommend this seller

This has the be the best phone ever made...  Almost two months since I've had this phone and no issues has occurred.  Love it

Excellent product, It's a beautifull smartphone and so productive, I recommend for all the family, is easy to use :)

No doubt, this galaxy S4 has most sharp,clear,and vivid color display.I compared with other lcd ips display and no one even comes closer.This phone has 5" Full hd 1080 amoled display , 2600mah of battery, Octa core Cpu. And stillThinner, lighter, smaller than Galaxy S3. galaxy S3 only got 4.8" display, 2100mah battery, and Quad core CPU.This is real innovation. Not aluminium case like iphone5 or htc one.Plastic case doesn't look as fancy as aluminium,but aluminium case easily get scratched and dents when you drop the phone.If you don't want damage on aluminium, you will buy case, then  What's the point of buying a aluminium phone?They are heavy,and thick, But plastic made galaxy S4 has Removable battery, Micro sd card and still thinner and lighter.For Facy appearance, just buy nice case, like I did. I bought SGP hybrid bumper case, and now my phone looksMuch better then other phones, but I didn't had to sacrifice sd card slot and removable battery for just looks of the  phone.13 M Pixel camera takes relly good quality pictures, Even  I transfered to my PC, still looks awesome.I bought one extra battery and charging cradle,and now I can't finish 2 batteries in one whole day.This is simply amazing phone.

The phone works perfectly. I recived just what they described. It came day earlier than I expected. I would highly recomend it to everyone.

The phone is absolutely amazing. No complaints whatsoever. Great performance, it was a great surprise because I ordered a different version of the same phone

Great seller and the best smartphone I have ever seen. Amazing, with this I can do everything, everything,My business, my study, and share my life style with my friends.

The phone works just fine, the battery keeps the charge as it should, the only thing is battery doesn't have the samsung original hologram and it is &#34;made in Japan, assembled in China&#34;.

I brought this phone a few months back and I waited to leave a review because I wanted to get a good feel for it first and I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone.

IT IS A SCAM!The seller sent me a fake chinese device. I tried to contact him and he said the company was in movin process, so i never could returned the product. I loosed my money but i want it back! Five  days after purchase the screen failed so i had to expend 256$ more to buy a new one ind when i tried to replace it the technician told me that my phone is chinese and the screen i bought doesn't fits. THIS HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

One of the most impressive things about the phone is the fact the size hasn't changed from its predecessor - the Galaxy S4 comes in at 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 inches, meaning there's no extra heft to try and work with in your palm.However, despite this fact, the screen on the S4 has been increased once more, to a whopping 5-inch display with Full HD resolution. This means the same amount of pixels you'd have seen on a TV that cost well over $1500 four years ago is now riding around in your pocket.Let's not pretend that Samsung is a pioneer in this area though: like a great many features of the Galaxy S4, the phone borrows a lot from the other top smartphones of the moment. Both the Sony Xperia Z and the HTC One have screens that rock the same resolution, but neither of them have the jaw-dropping clout of the Super AMOLED HD screen on display here.On top of that, there's a much faster processor packed under the hood, ample storage space for media thanks to an expandable memory card slot, and the likes of 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and pretty much any other connection you care to mention on board.One thing that isn't mentioned in most literature is that the Galaxy S4 boasts OTG compatibility.  Use an OTG cable like this:Micro USB OTG Cable - LIFETIME WARRANTYand you can connect a myriad of devices (USB thumb drive, game pad, mouse/keyboard, DSLR camera and a lot more).  Why don't more phone manufactures promote this hardware tech?!?Samsung has tried to supplement this with a load of software upgrades too, meaning a more powerful camera, a better way to communicate with your friends and consume media, and, interestingly, a big push into personal health through dedicated apps.The Samsung Galaxy S4 costs a little more than the HTC One, well, it does for memory.  Same price for the 16GB S4 as the 32GB HTC (pay a $40 premium to get a 32GB Galaxy, when they're released).  Of course, the S4's removable storage option, which the One lacks, levels the playing field some, as SD cards aren't too pricey.The other notable addition to the design of the Galaxy S4 is the infra-red blaster on the top of the phone. This allows you to control your TV, satellite box, DVD player, amp and even air conditioner, according to the reviewer notes. Again, this isn't a new feature, but it works well in practice, and despite being small it's powerful enough indeed.I do implore you to get the phone in your hand before making a judgment though - while it doesn't have the best design on the market when it comes to materials, it's a big step forward compared to the Galaxy S3 and allows for a grippy and easy-to-hold phone, with a whopping screen inside.To just dismiss it for being plastic would be doing the S4 a disservice as it has so much more going for it than that, but it's worth remembering that to a lot of people, the way a phone looks is as important as how much RAM it's got on board and how fast the CPU is - if not more so.All in all, this is a phone worth reviewing.  It may not be for all users, but for the power users among us, there simply may be no equal.

we can not compare any other phone with this phone, even i phone. it is more than every thing and I can not explain about this phone in words.Madhusudhanan

I bought this thinking it was the international version but instead of what i expected i got a t-mobile version but it came unlocked, that's my only problem, so far.

I have had this phone for a year now.  I love the feature when you change the device settings and then restart the phone, it will default to the old settings.  This is good for a number of reasons.  I have a lot of time during the day to setup the phone.  Its customizable.  When I dropped it the screen cracked and Best Buy said its not covered in the insurance.  That is typical of insurance.  Another great feature is when ATT updates the phone (you cant ignore the update) it renders the phone useless for a few days.  I cant wait for the Samsung LEmon, definitely going to upgrade when this comes out.

This was definitely NOT a new phone. Clearly refurbished! GPS didn't work!! Stay clear!!!

Ad stated that it is an international phone. Not so will not work in many countries. Pic shows T-mobile which is a GSM phone..a Verizon phone was delivered... The Otterbox shown is a protective case and has nothing to do with the phone at all. Customer service took forever to get through to, but was helpful when answering. BEWARE

It was a gift for her, she love it a lot and want to buy more "clothes" for it wear so it looks new all the time...and she also treat like her precious, keep away from watchful eyes of thiefs, but show off like a rattle snake waving its tail as it awaiting for it's prey. So I did bought a whole bunches of its "clothes"  for her precious :)..

The greatest smartphone I ever had. Started with the Galaxy 1 then went for the S2 and jumped right to the S4.I love Samsung's products. I think no one beats them.

i really am amazed by this phone, its friendly to use has great widgets and the color is beautiful, love it.

After I buy this phone,after a month,when I go to public place,like Macys,you know there is a public WI-FI inside. I can search it,I already open my wi-fi,even though I connected,the phone says I already connected,but I can't go to Internet!can someone tell me why why?When I was using my Iphone 4s,I still can go to Internet,but now!!!Every public wi-fi I can't use it!!!

this is not international version , and sent the old scratches phone, i would rate 1 star only, sent wrong item and have a connection with USPS to steal item from buyer

Im yet to unravel the full potential of the device but what i have seen so far it's truly amazing of the power and functionality that can be packed into such a small unit.  The screen size and resolution are optimized for great viewing experience.  Never want to leave my phone.  Great work and cudos to the developers and Sansung Co.

Satisfied

I have owned for several weeks now. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. Only a few minor things to complain of. I use this with Family Mobile through Walmart. As expected it was indeed unlocked and after making an account with Family mobile I was online and making calls within 15 minutes. Family mobile only offers a few gigs of 3G and then goes to 2G the rest of the month but this phone is lightning fast no matter what. Videos load with a quickness. Rarely lose signal. One thing I dislike, which may be my particular phone is glitched, but when making calls, the sensor  doesn't detect if my face is there or not. Unless I turn the sensor off it is black even when I take my face away. Annoying. Also, once in a while my screen flips out and then restarts the phone. Once it restarts it's okay but after paying over 500 I wish it wasn't glitchy at all. Games are fun, battery is decent and charges quickly.

Looooove my new phone. I bought it and thought maybe it wouldnt work in peru.. was sooo wrongggg!!  I love it. Works perfectly fine here

I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my wife sending it to my daughter at college, who was coming home for Christmas vacation, so good so far. While in route between Memphis Tn. and Cairo Egypt it was removed from her luggage. It hadn't  been opened so I don't have a serial number to initiate the kill feature. I filed a report With the TSA in Memphis giving them the route Memphis Tn. USA, New Jersey USA, Paris France and finally Cairo Egypt. They said they needed this information to check their videos. I haven't a clue what they found. I bought a used Samsung Galaxy, as a replacement, but it burned up a month ago. I ended up getting my wife an iPhone 5 from a service provider here.Over the years I have bought too much stuff from both Amazon USA and Amazon UK, with generally good results. With me, it just takes once, and I'm done. I know this is not the place for this, but I felt I should at least try something, being 72 I'm not all that tech savvy, this is the only thing I thought of doing. If we can't use the phone it's no good to us. If I can't kill it, Amazon or the seller might seek out the present user for a review.

Loving it! This Android phone is easy to navigate.  Easy to use.  Has more features than I will need.  And the battery will last a day and a half.

Galaxy S4 is better than the S3. However, it tends to get hot when used a lot. It is perfect if not used for long periods.

Its worth the wait. It did satisfy me. Continue your good services. Its awesome. It arrive just in time and the quality is really great. :)))

Excellent equipment in good condition in box with accessories as is as indicated by the 100% recommend publication, for which we like the new in technology this phone is the maximum!

I bought this phone for my daughter and she just love it.  lots of internal memory.it's a great phone. I've recommended it to several of my friends already.

This phone is awesome! I had the S2 which is really good, but this one is so great! So many things you can do. I love it! I totally recommend it!

very good and very smart you have to buy this samsung made it crystal clear with this 5inch phone great camera and sounds

First off I would like to say that I am a web & mobile developer by trade and a device geek by hobby. Samsung surpassed iPhones back with the S2, but admittedly they fell just short in regards of being reliable and as usable. The S4 is the first Android phone I have used that seems to be the complete package.Gestures: The gestures seem gimmicky and I haven't yet used them much but I do enjoy that it detects my eyes because I read on my phone for long periods of time and can forget about whether the screen will go off.Camera: I love the camera, it works great much like the S3 but obviously a bit better. The only downfall is that the gallery app on this phone seems to be buggy compared to past versions, so hopefully that is pending an update.Device Feel: The S4 fits much more comfortably in my hands than previous Samsung or iPhone models. It has a squared off edge so it rests in your hand better without accidentally hitting the soft keys.The way I use it is with a T-mobile month to month plan and I seem to have much better coverage and network speed than I had with the S3. I have yet to test it Internationally.There is almost no comparison to the reliability and speed of this phone. I have had it crash after doing some serious application downloading and testing but it resets and is back to normal far faster than the screen-of-death freeze I had on previous phones.I've spent a lot of time researching this phone and others and I am very happy with my S4.

This item arrived on time, looked great, and functions like it was new.  It was reasonably priced, and I have had no problems with it.  If you would like to purchase this phone, I would definitely recommend it.

This phone is the absolute best on the market. Got firmware and software updates within 2 minutes of setup. Everything works and works well.

Love this phone. Quality of pictures taken is amazing; size of the screen is perfect; not too big; not too small.

I gave this phone a five it met all expectations.It's slick looking lots of apps availableGreat for teenagers

great product, the quality of the screen in excellent, the design is gorgeous, it is very fast phone, the camera is the best, love it...

This phone is incredible.  Wonderful screen.  Great apps.  Love the Screen Mirroring with the Samsung TV.  If you can get it under contract instead of paying full price it would be better.

The phone was like brand new, but arrived locked from ATT, the model is I337, beware before buying, ask first.

This rating was chosen because I liked it and everything in it and I have already recommended this product to my friends.

It is a great product I love my new phone galaxy forever and I love the features of the phone

The international version of the S3 actually has a an Exynos 8-core processor. So this version is faster than the typical one you would get from AT&T.

Awesome phone!!! Only a few days in and it's  my favorite phone ever. Not sure how i was getting along without it before.

Amazing phone. !  Great battery life.  It stunned me right out of the box.  I highly recommend it.Samsung is the name to trust when it comes to cell phones!Buy it!

I purchased this item less than a month ago and my daughter put it in her back pocket, walked a few steps, took it out to check it and the screen was gone black. She did not sit down or bump into anything. I took it back to the retailer for warranty, they checked it and told me the internal screen was cracked and that they would not receive it for warranty because they thought it had fallen (this was in Latin America). I have had a lot of other phones and they have not broken by putting it in the pocket, not even falling down. In the family there is also an SIII, that one fell and the internal screen did not crack. Think about it before buying this phone!

Simply perfect, a lot better than any Iphone, because it is much faster, smoother and compatible with a lot of videos formats. You can sure buy it. Camera rocks with a lot of functions and very good quality as well.

Has always Samsung did it great...Samsung Galaxy S4 is the greatest smartphone nowadays...No complains about it... I love my SGS4

The phone is great, there are plenty of reviews that will give you all the details, my concern is the number of Chinese made Counterfeit phones doing the rounds.My first purchase was from REvans065, and was counterfeit. My second was from FGS Trading and was genuine.Insist that the phone you buy is factory sealed in the box, and watch the YouTube videos on how to spot the fakes.Lastly, read the seller reviews. REvans065 had a 100% positive rating when I purchased from him, he now has almost 70% negative as he's selling counterfeit phones. Even Amazon isn't a totally safe place to buy, although the return policy does protect you. If the 'Fulfilled by Amazon' option is available, use it. I saved $10 on the purchase price and then wasted 2 weeks of my time and $15 sending a counterfeit phone back and getting a refund.You have been warned.

The phone is totally new and I am really satisfied with it. The air gesture seems to have a little problem but it is okay cos I will not use it frequently. The power runs out fast when it is hot. I dropped it from about 1.5 meters high oncewhile the screen was not broken, just some scratches and damages on the frame.

Wow! Samsung really top it with this phone. Great speed, great memory, the apps are awesome, the quality of the screen is great, not heavy at all, the general performance is outstanding, the best phone out there with no doubt

Samsung phone user gone to apple this phone turned me away couldnt stand it.

Amazing phone! Genuine Samsung product, works like a charm. I have no problems with it. I would recommend buying this phone.

The best cell at the time.I have been dropped and nothing happens to the cell.It has excellent resolution and the pictures are incredible

I bought this phone to test our NFC forum type 3 smart tag with our Android app, and found it is so hard to communicate, most of the times failed. you have to touch the tag to a specific spot of the phone to make it work, but still not always work.  Samgung Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus are much better with NFC function.

I Cant Express Enough Words For this Phone this Phone does so much. its amazing i would recommend this phone to all

I love my cellphone it works great it works in honduras it came with all the accessories and it camd on time

she loves it works really good it works whatever she wants its really fast and the battery works all day long.

Just so we all know this  specific device is a voice over IP phone only, which means no network on the face of the planet will carry this phone! Not happy to spend $500 on a device to replace my broken one just to find out that it won't work with my carrier! This should be made evident in the description of the product. Yet again I am very happy with the Samsung device that I currently have! (the S4) It's a great phone all in all, the seller just needs to put better information in the description of the device!

I ended up returning this phone after realizing a better deal through a Verizon loophole, but overall I am extremely satisfied with the S4, I think it is the best phone on the market.

Simply enjoyed. Bought to be used in Brazil and so far is working exactly as expected. Thank you so much!!

The product was everything i expected , yes it was the i9500 which has the exynos octa processor and it came band new, definitely would buy from this sellr again.

Love love love my phone. Im hooked this phone is never far from me.  Samsung you're amazing.  Three thumbs up. Phone was delivered in record time. Kudos to the seller.

I received the phone and is locked. If you want, I can send you the pictures on the back that say ESPRINT?If I bought a Unlocked phone, why I recieved a lock phone.  I will call to AMAZONE to complain.RegardsGuillermo VilloriaGuillermo Villoria

Although it is 'FACTORY UNLOCKED' that does not mean it can be used with any carrier. I needed to use it for verizon, come to find out it was a T-mobile phone that is only unlocked to be used with AT&T since they both use a SIM card to operate their entire software. When I took it to the verizon store it was explained to me the only unlocked phone verizon can hook up is sprint.

It doesn't work. The batery does not charge. I want to change, but i'm already in Brasil and i don't know how.

After 1 month with the phone, I've realize it's a fake one, and I bought the original one later one so I could see the DIFFERENCE, which is HUGE ! PLEASE, research a lot about the products before purchasing ! I was stup... and lost my money with those "smart" people !

The greatest cell phone I've ever owned. the sreeen is big, with amazing resolution, precision and response to commands. Recommend it

Awesome phone... can't believe people still buy iphones.... a bit hard to learn how to use at first but afterwards its an awesome piece of technology.

I have long been a huge android supporter. I have had every phone in the Galaxy S series with no complaints...until I got my S4. Everything in me wants to write a good review about this phone, because my friends have been happy with theirs, but mine had a pretty significant problem. My phone worked great for a couple of months but then the problems hit.It began saying that there was no SIM card in my phone even when it was clearly inserted all of the way and it would make me reset my phone. So I took it to the AT&T; store and got a new SIM card which worked well for all of ten minutes and the problem came back.It just became part of the phone having to reset it every couple of hours when the message popped up. But then the screen also started to become discolored and slowly the discolored area kept growing and growing. Eventually it got to the point where I had to take it back.Because it was a hardware problem I got a new phone free of charge and my new S4 is working amazingly. No complaints with this one. Maybe I just got a bad unit, but it stopped me from giving it a better rating.

The product was the way I expected and it came in time for me to go back to brazil, the only problem was one earphone that wasn't working well

amaizing phone, everything works fine I really apreciate it, they are very trusted and always achieve their promeses its very good team

This product is great, very easy to use and full of apps.The shipment was fast and I could keep track of its arrival.

The device that I was shipped looks like a Samsung S4 but when you start the phone you immediately can tell that its not a Samsung S4.Samsung did not build this phone!!!  the display is much much inferior, the camera in this is NOT the 13 Megapixel camera you would expect to find on an Samsung S4! this camera has only 5 mp at best and not to mention that many camera functions and also many other device functions are no where to be found in this device. This fake device is about 3 times heavier them an authentic Samsung S4! The main button feels like its got a lifespan of 50 clicks! The Screen freezes all the time!!!!!!!I am filing a claim against this seller for selling me a fake phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The phone is brand new. SFSG. working fine as the first week. Love the screen resolution. 4 stars is always my number when rating a product on any websiteS that is honest which I always find on Amazon, NOT EBAY !!!

I am not becoming one of those apple drones with their show-off iPhone 5s and iPad Air devices.  The only way to have choice is competition and supporting those trying to catch up with Apple.  Apple also works with the US government in listening to terrorists, and Samsung is from Korea, so I don't have to worry about government listening cause even if the Koreans did, I don't speak Korean!  I don't need apps so I don't care if android ones supposedly crash more.  I also don't use the camera, and any criticisms are just lies from Apple iPhone users.  I use it to make calls, and it works.  Samsung is way cooler.

It is very good I like so much the samsung arrived very fast and in perfect box with security very good

The phone was bought as a gift for my wife. I hope she like it. The big and clear screen let the quality of shown very nice.

This is my first time to use a high tech phone and I really like it, easy to use, very handy, although it seems a bit large in the beginning, when I got used to, now other phones look so small to me.

Great design, excellente functionality, light weight, easy to use, definitely the best smartphone in the market today, and in the foreseeable future.

This is a very nice phone! I love it a lot! It takes clear photos and the wide screen is suitable for both good looking and using.It is convenient to hold the phone.And it also has some very humanized program for people to use.

This product is not original, it does not work the air gestural nor any similar applications, I can not update, and nothing that the seller told me if it was. shame that bad, I lost my money ...

This is international phone so if you live in US, it is not a very good this to do.It does not have 4G LTE.But I still like it.

This is the best cellphone ever. It is fast and super easy to use. I definitely will recommend this product,

Okay so this phone is very ultra mega amazing and I love it!I originally had a Focus which is a Windows Phone it's like first generation which suited me well but since I don't have an iPod I was lacking apps like snap chat and instagram. SOoooooo! I switched to the galaxy s4! I did a lot of research on this phone which I would highly recommend. There are a few minor problems that I found with the galaxy s4 which you will find listed on some of the websites if you research it, I was already aware of these problems when I got mine.The phone over heats, I live in a place where it's cold so that didn't really bother me but boy did that phone lose all of it's battery quickly, by lunch time I had to turn off my phone so I could still call my parents to get a ride home after practice. So far this has only happened once (today), so I can say very little on this topic.Even without overheating the he battery life isn't that long. I don't use my phone very much during school hours (DUH!) but I found that by the time practice ended I needed to recharge my phone, I've also found sometimes it takes a while for the phone to charge. I would recommend buying a case with an extra battery to help out with that, that's what I did.If you're a huge music person... well... all I have to say is you'll be disappointed with how loud the speaker is, cause it's not very loud, at least not compared to the Focus. Headphones are fine obviously.If you're just now switching to an Android like I did, have patience it take a little while to figure it out, but honestly the OS is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, even though old habits die hard hahaha I can almost promise you though that at first you are going to be completely lost and are gonna be asking yourself how you got to a certain window hahaOkay now for some positiveness!The camera is amazing!The images on the screen seam like they are gonna pop out, it's almost like your holding miniature actors in your hand while they do their thing!The app selection is amazing and don't be worried about using Google Play, it's brilliant and fast!You'll love the small little details that samsung put into that phone, but I'm not gonna give those away hehethey have a lot of features that you can use that are fun to use. I havent used all of that fancy eye stuff it has because well... I just didn't have a need for it.For you music people out there the music library is kinda really awesome and I love it, it's completely easy to use.I cant think of anything I was worrying about with phone before I got it that I can help you guys out with, I just know that I'm completely satisfied and happy with this phone and I'm pretty sure you will too! :) I was completely worth tht insane amount of money hehe

Just got it. Ive been using it for few days now and I love it. It is definitely not a fake one. I was able to do all the set up with Samsung website. I love this phone. Currntly using it in the US with Ultra mobile.

It's a very good pone. Parts manufactured in Korea and assembled in Vietnam.I recommend the seller, very responsible and mobile delivery sealed in its original package.Cons: the battery charger is European.

Very fast to ship.Recomend this item to you all!I bought this item to use on Brazil and work perfectely as the description said!Great product!Love it!

Last phone I brought at other place has a some problem, the camera always fail. But this one is perfect. S4 is light, it has big screen, nice color tone . The muti window function is quite useful and convenient. Samsung's product is good.

instead of a Unlocked International, I got a LOCKED, NATIONAL one!I had to unlock it & spend more money on it.Better for supplier checks before sending the phone.

I own S4 about a month, but I have not discovered all its secret functions. Works fine in Brazil, where I live. No regrets for choosing a more expensive gadget. No lags, no processing issues due multiple tasks (the multiple tasks bar is awesome). No complains at all.

Too many random bugs and glitches. Latest glitch is the phone not actually recording what I recoreded. Avoid samsung phones!

I feel deceived. In July 2013 I bought an S4 to Amazon and after 6 months found that the equipment spends the battery very quickly (4 hours).  After consulting various blogs and web pages I've noticed that my computer is a Chinese clone and it is not an original Korean. He then quoted the corresponding Web page:[...]According to the services authorized Samsung, apparently this is happening frequently sold as original equipment by Amazon. I think it is time that Samsung intervene since this is ruining the brand. For my part I am a faithful customer of Amazon and this is the sixth team Samsung that you bought. Before happened to me with a S2 which it was changed by Amazon correctly. I hope again Amazon has an answer for me

I bought a Galaxy S4 last week and I'm really impressed. One of the first things that amazed me was that after 1 day, 6 hours and 56 minutes of use the phone said I still had 17% left on my battery. This was after heavy use setting up the screens, adding apps, texting, talking, browsing and more. Our power went out for a while and I even used the flashlight and an app to read a book for 25 minutes. Hands down, the S4 is the winner over the iPhone.Phone was easy to set up for email and apps. Changing screen layouts was also a breeze. It was also great that I could just pull the memory chip out of my last phone, slide it in to the S4 and had all my contacts, music, photos and everything else in seconds. Didn't have to worry about uploading from the old phone and than downloading to the new.Used the 13mp camera and pictures were sharp and clear. Also liked the panorama function. Took some video and was equally impressed.I use this phone a lot for business and the clarity of the phone was great. Others even mentioned without asking how clear my voice was.I was showing the phone to a friend who is a big supporter of the main competitor and he tried to challenge the navigation. He spoke his address really fast from a distance and was surprised when it showed up perfectly in a millisecond. Good luck with that one Seri.Last, but not least, it's fast. Scrolling through screens, apps, on the browser and everything else this phone is fast. Perhaps the quad core processor and 2 GB of ram compared to a dual core and 1 GB for the iPhone made the difference.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone on all accounts. I did have one concern prior to purchasing. I thought the phone my just be too big. It isn't. I checked, put the phone in a belt clip, put it on and couldn't tell the difference from my Droid. The larger higher resolution screen is great. I also like the fact that you're not stuck buying only Apple products for the phone. My car charger from my Droid worked find and the same charger charges my Kindle. Three different, products, three different companies and they all work together. Not with Apple. Sorry iPhone, but the hype has got tiring. It doesn't seem to do anything as well as the S4 and you're still stuck with the short battery life with an iPhone.Final ScoreGalaxy S4 10iPhone  0Buy it!

I do not like this product because it is not useful, and the quality is not good. when I got this product, it has been damaged.

Love this phone! It is amazing.  Everything is working right so far. Ny only problem is that they didnt send me a good adaptor for my phone  charger thankfully I have a tab 3 or I would have  been screwed

Do not buy the cellphone from this seller. The battery dies in less than 4 hours, the cellphone sometimes doesn't respond, and it has so many flaws. I regret buying it without warranty do not make the same mistake.

Since Amazon (and his Seller) solved the problem right away ( I will really know when able to see my bank account next month...since Im traveling and far away from home), I cant really rate the phone itself, since the phone that was shipped to me,  WAS NOT AN ORIGINAL SAMSUNG S4. IT WAS A BAD CHINESE COPY that had an even smaller screen (not even AMOLED) than my Samsung S3 that I also bought from/through Amazon some time beck.I was so dissapointed with the transaction, that I went to a store, in Miami, and ended bying a Note 2, instead of the S4. Im a Samsung addict!!

I bought this phone for someone else and she's delighted with it. She says it meets all her expectations and she'd recommend it to friends and family.

This is the best smartphone in the market today. Big and the best screen, a lot of functions, very fast. Price is high, but you have what you pay for.

The only problem is that I live in Venezuela and the phone does not have the option for the Laguages in spanish! But the phone is Awesome!

It said it hat a certaing amount of memory and when it came, surprise!!...it only had half!--- be sure to check that!

The SG#4 is the best smartphone out now, The I phone 5 can not touch it. I will tell all my friends about it.

good night, I write from Venezuela ... leonel I wonder if you have more phones, I have thought to make another purchase

I purchased a galaxy s4 wonderful phone.....NOT!  this thing stopped charging in two months the costumer support rep told me this is a common issue from there he told me he would fix it in 13-18 business days 2 to 3 weeks! yeah i am upset no more samsung phones for me wanted you all to know this about a company that dons't care about its costumers.  Apple replaces on site no questions asked i switched for all the bells and whistles well i got messed up by samsung thanks samsung for nothing.

Very nice smartphone, almost perfect! All software provided by Android gives you a wide list of options to both my work and entertainment, backed by stuning photos, video and music. The negative is the battery, which doesn't back all the power delivered by the phone.

As expected! Great!In the box, with all the accessories, manuals and proper protection of the package delivered.I will recommend this phone!

I want to start by saying I got this phone at my local AT&T store and unlocked from any seller. Coming from an iPhone user for years, this phone is amazing. As I type this on my mac ironically enough, I was tired of Apple. I picked this up on my upgrade, and my first impressions were that it was WAY too big (screen wise) after about 2 weeks of using it, I look at iPhone screens and seriously question why I ever liked the screen on them. I can easily touch all corners of this screen without stretching too much and I have very average sized hands for a guy. Coming from a gamer, the S4 is a totally different breed from iPhone at least in the emulation area. It can run almost any N64/PSX game at 40-60fps constantly. The only thing I could complain about this phone is heating. Now it's a very powerful phone and it will run warm when gaming. I had a defect my first time around with this phone at was running at 120F. I replaced it and have had no problems since. I can't rave anymore about how everyone should at least give the S4 a chance. I used to make fun of their giant appearance, but now I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm hooked.

I bought 2 Galaxy S4, a black (actually very good) and this white. He did not come with 16GB of memory as advertised but with 8Gb. The system is Linux (how is this possible?). And the power plug is not the standard American, but an european (or whatever the where), and even sent an adapter to &#34;solve&#34; the problem. I bought and paid for one thing and got another. I am very disappointed and don't recommend the product.

i bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. she's been using it for six months with no problems. great buy for the price.

I bought this phone through Amazon Warehouse deals (in very good condition) and have had a horrible experience. When I opened the box, I noticed the side of the phone was smashed in with dents on both sides of the device. I later found out the volume buttons didn't work correctly, and finally that the phone is a fake selling for $500+ dollars. I am returning this and getting the phone from a legitimate carrier.

I'm loving it!ProsGreat Screen, great camera!ConsThere are not so many gadgets for it, I'm used to Aplle products.

The size and performance are outstanding, the best phone in the market right now in my opinion, but the screen may break very easily with hits or falls that way cheaper phones would resist without any problem.

I love the phone, it is not much bigger than the S3 or even the S2 and the bigger screen make viewing much easier. The switching to the micro sim is my only down side to the product, but great in terms of functionality.

my only problem with this phone is that the manuals were not in english....praise god for yoytube this phone has amazing features

I love everything about this phone except the fact that the battery does not work very well. I charge my phone during the whole night & by 5 or 6 pm the battery is around 40% already.

the best purchase and made

I am coming from a Galaxy S2. I've always wanted to have the Galaxy S4 since I didn't get the S3. Generally, I am amazed at Samsung's new features such as Smart Pause, Air Gesture and Air View. That's what I saw on some videos that it can do all that. But when I tried doing it myself, it wouldn't do anything. I guess it has got something to do with upgrading the software from the moment I received the unit. It may have messed up some features because of that. Other than that, I love my S4.

my phone does not work, have the damaged plate, do not grab any kind of signal, no good. as I do for my money back. the q does evil, evil is doing in this life

The camera on this phone is horrible. My older version HTC had a much better camera than this phone. So disappointed!

good phone I recommend 100% intact its wine shipping was superfast and I am proud to have a phone with latest technology that will soon come to market

Good service is something I really appreciate and I must say that my expectations were surpassed when it came to buying this phone. I am very pleased with my S4. It arrived on time and exactly as described. I recommend Amazon, ShopBest and this phone without a doubt.

I bought this item for a friend, I worth to spend $630 on this phone, Works perfect on Ecuador with a SD 64 GB

My review of the iPhone 5s versus the Galaxy s4 (in case any of you are upgrading phones and trying to decide). Side note: Like Coke and Pepsi, there will be folks that are biased toward one or the other, but my hope is to point out some key differences should it help others in their overall decision making process.iPhone 5s-Better native keyboard &#8211; more precise and predictive. More natural feel when typing. The auto correct is great on the 5s.-Siri &#8211; Smoother and better voice accuracy. More natural and intuitive. I provide commands (&#8220;remind me about the 8am dentist appointment on December 31th&#8221;) and Siri understands. If I issued the same command on the Galaxy S4, the voice recognition would be confused and misinterpret.-The overall Volume of speaker is louder on the 5s than on the Galaxy S4. I can hear the ringer from other rooms.-In my car and using the speakerphone on the 5s, others tell me the sound quality is night and day compared to the Galaxy S4 (Verizon). When I had my S4 (two different ones), they said I sounded garbled or as if I was talking through a tin can.-I have yet to experience an application crash on the 5s-The Camera is quick to snap shots and pictures are sharp-Availability of iMessage and Facetime. Makes communicating with other Apple users simple. I can see when they are typing a reply back to me, and I can even Facetime in the car or from anywhere without having to download an configure a 3rd party app such as Skype, and then hope the person on the other end had done the same (I have family who are not technology savvy, but easily use Facetime).-The iOS7 operating system is overall more refined and user friendly (i.e. &#8211; you can hold down and click X to delete an application on the iPhone rather than get confused trying to find the Settings/Application submenus on the Android/S4)-In my area, better overall signal quality / antenna strength. No dropped calls in the same spots I used my S4.Galaxy S4-I like having a &#8216;Back&#8217; button (bottom left arrow)-The S4 has a larger screen / more real estate-The S4 camera can lag (would display &#8216;Processing&#8217; message for 2-3 seconds while images save). Images were often blurry or not as sharp as I had hoped even after adjusting various settings.-I do like having a removable battery and accessories available with the S4 such as a wireless charger.-I don&#8217;t like having to close various apps at least daily when they lock up/crash (Android Force Close / Process Stopped Unexpectedly errors). This may be more developer related than phone related, however, this does not happen with my iPhone 5s.-Larger variety of apps. Not as restrictive as Apple in how you can modify and customize your phone (could be both a pro and con). I also like being able to use the Amazon App Store, where you can get a free download each day.Overall impressions:For me personally, the iPhone 5s is the way to go. Although the perfect phone, for me, would include combining the best features from both, Apple is the clear winner with regards to the features and functionality that matter most to me.

Other than shipping issues, the phone itself was great. The SIM card slot was smaller than my SIM card, but got that fixed.

Excellent product in a record time! I'm so happy with my new phone!100% recommended!Thanks for your attention! !
