Easy to use...great price!

This is my emergency replacement smartphone. My trusted Samsung Galaxy SII Skyrocket died suddenly. As I am 5 months shy of my contract renewal date, AT&T offered me the option of purchasing a new phone at full price ($600, amortized over 24 months at $25 per month).  No thank you, I'll &#34;limp along&#34; with a replacement phone for 5 months until I can buy a contemporary smartphone (Galaxy S IV or V) for $!00-$200 by signing a new contract.  For a few days I used an ancient iphone just so that I would have voice contact with the outside world.  But clearly, I needed something more modern to tide me over my 5 month wait.  This phone fits the bill. It has the same processor and Android OS version as my beloved Galaxy SII, meaning that this is circa 2011 technology. Not exactly state-of-the-art, but not too antiquated.  It isn't quite a Samsung clone--but not a bad attempt.  You need to know that it has 4G capability on AT&T--NOT 4G LTE.  Also, it does not have visual voicemail. I haven't explored it enough to know if it has voice dialing. I've paired it with 2 sets of bluetooth headphones but am not sure it will pair with my car's bluetooth. (Car manufacturer's website lists specific makes/models of phones that are compatible; it lists only one ZTE phone model which is a different model number). Quirky swipe required to answer phone before call goes to voicemail--still getting used to it. NOTE: This ZTE Go Phone is not carried in all AT&T stores. AT&T stores stock a less expensive ZTE built phone (the AT&T Avail).  While it would be convenient to pick up the Avail as your replacement phone while in the AT&T store, please read reviews first. Slower phone with a delicate screen prone to easily break.  Better to take the time to track down this Radiant as your replacement smartphone for perhaps $10 to $15 more.  Order here on Amazon, AT&T website or stocked in most walmarts.

For the price, this is an amazing phone.  For twice the price, this is an amazing phone.  Runs fast, and with an inserted memory card, has more than enough space.  The google OS is great for someone who uses GMail et al, as the integration is seamless.

For the price...what is there not to like,PRICEAndroidJelly Bean$50 less, .5&#34; smaller screen and slightly faster processor than Z998remedied the on-board storage discrepancy by getting 32gb card { http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E1XI6PS/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 }and still came out less than the z998,I downloaded spotify synced it offline and my mother is a happy camper and can now manage her pictures betterA bit dim on the screen brightness and a candy form style are negligible negatives but everything is a positive.

It is sleek and eye catching.It is very easy to use and simple to understand. I like the size because it fits nicely in my hand when I am texting.

I only have a flip phone to compare this to but I'm pretty pleased with the AT&T Radiant, and was able to easily hook into H2O Wireless service with it at a huge cost savings. Phone guide is fairly self-explanatory; easy to get started and I can't imagine other features that I will ever need! Great value!

Not too big and not too small.Runs all my apps flawlessly (including GTA, Soul Calibur, Re-Volt and a bunch of other 1st person shooters.It even runs XBMC 1Channel and Icefilms.

This is an awful phone.  The sound quality is poor, you cannot use the keypad because it disappears as you try to touch it, when you are talking on the phone if your face touches any part of the screen apps open up,... I could go on and on, bottom line... buy something else.

yes it has a high version of android and has 1GB of ram which is 2nd highest or 3rd highest speed of all smartphones. it has a dual core 1.4 ghz processor but the processor as we all know, doens't mean anything. its all about the memory (ram). 1 GB is really fast or fast enough. some parts of the phone are really cheap. like how icons keep disappearing from my desktop or wallpaper.  and it does freeze alot. and there are only 3 pages of wallpaper. weird. they cut alot of corners to justify affording to put 1 GB of ram on it. the touch screen is better. i used to have a fusion 2 go phone. everything was nice except for the lack of memory and the low version of android.

Great phone for a go phone,  I used it as a replacement from my last phone.  I am a paying at&t customer who uses go phones for back up phones.  Not alot of difference between this phone & avail 2 but size of screen.

Not quite as intuitive as I had hoped, but a big step forward for me and I'm glad I did it!

this phone is exactly as it says , would recommend this phone no problems with it at all...

I love the speed of downloads, has 4Glte data connection, and has smooth interface with Jelly Bean operating system. I'm not the one that has to have the newest and the best, just one that works.  And I can say this smart phone fits the bill.I did have some issues with the internet connection, but AT&T; was very helpful with making sure settings were correct on the phone, and things seem to be running smoothly now.

We've tried a few different smart phones & I have to say, that so far, this one is the best.  I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a phone.  THis one is reasonably priced, pretty easy to learn to use.  My only gripe is I wish the battery life was a little better, but it's not so bad we can't live with it!

When I was employed, I had a super nice LG android smartphone, which I loved.  being unemployed now and on a strict budget, I was thrilled to find this phone in the GoPhone family.  I have had this phone for less than a week and I am soo very pleased and happy with my purchase.  It has all of the Android familiar apps and icons, easy to use, make calls, text, and go online.  I am not a &#34;follow the crowd&#34; kind of woman, so I was not going to follow the whole Samsung &#34;phenomenon&#34;, as well as pay the ridiculous prices for these lines of phones.  The Radiant is perfect!  Now, I am on a mission to find a screen protector and case for it, as I am scared to death I will scratch and/or break the screen.  :)

My 11 year old daughter loves it!!! Hard to find a case for this phone but other than that it's working perfectly.

This device does everything I need.  I really like the fact that it has both Wi-Fi and 4G.  I like the speakerphone because it makes it much easier to hear conversations.  I would recommend this phone.

I've had this thing for about a month and half.1) Multi-Tasking is limitedI can play a game (NES Emulator) and conduct a phone call without a problem.I can listen to music and play the same game (Dr. Mario)I can conduct a call and use the browser2) Here the problems thougha) The browser must be the included Internet Explorer as Google Chrome is resource heavy to use on this phone.b) Shop Kick causes a bunch of problems, it will work somewhat okay if you're not doing anything else. If you are listening to music (file or streaming) and start scanning items to get kicks (points) the audio will stop playing after a few minutes. After that, it might cause Shop Kick to crash or the &#34;app.google.com&#34; to stop working.That requires a hard reboot of the phone. I will try Fast Reboot to see if that will solve the problem of during hard boot to get the phone back functionally properly.Other than that issue (I have made $155 worth of gift cards with Shop Kick so its function is important!) the phone works as advertised.As reported in other reviews the camera really isn't that good. Even with flash it takes terrible low light pictures. If you're going to take any indoor pictures with this, I highly recommend a high kelvin natural sunlight bulb or small LED light to make up for the poor quality or just take pictures in bridge sunlight only.I haven't tried video but it suffers from the same problems. The better the lighting the better the video will look.I have broken my LG Optimus G, so much for Gorilla Glass, so I was forced to find a cheap substitute until I can get it fixed.I will likely get it fixed because of the Shopkick problems (along with Beyond Podcast when multi-tasking) and this ZTE phone is just slower and has less RAM available.My options are to get the G fix ($160) or sell the Radiant + $160 and get a Moto G 4G LTE when its launched or get the One+1 when its finally released.

Best Buy has it recently but in AT&T; Stores its not available yet. These phone its from ZTE-USA. Has a 1.4 Dual Core processor  (no lagging or freeze yet) and a decent resolution screen of 480 x 800. Has a 5.0 MP back camera but the pictures in low light are not so good even using the flash. In outdoor the pictures are ok after some adjustments in brightness and exposure. You can change, WB, ISO, Metering in the camera and also include some effects that you can use. It doesn't came with a front camera (sorry girls, no self portraits). Can record 720P video with audio (not impressed). Also took pictures during recording video. It is a 4G and not LTE 4G technology. I get it to replace my Samsung Galaxy S3. I have a 2 year contract and the warranty expire 2 month ago meanwhile so I have 2 choices: (Contact the Insurance and pay double the price of the Z740 Radiant or buy a gophone).I only move my existing microsim from my S3 and have a new phone. Good battery duration. Its has WIFI capability and that is perfect for me and not have to use all my data of my contract plan. I installed a 16GB micro SD and works fine for increase the storage capacity (Only has an internal memory storage of 2GB) so be careful installing to much programs or games from Google.If you want a no contract phone for the price really you will enjoy it. If you looking to get excellent pictures, this its not the phone for you. No cases, extra battery or screen protectors are available yet.**UPDATE** (1/16/2014)Finally I found a replacement battery on Ebay and in Amazon. Its the same for the Avid 4G N9120 or Force N9100.**UPDATE** (3/10/2014)Amazon start to bring covers to the z740. Heres the link:LF Bundle Accessory Hybridy Protector

Works way better than the HTC inspire I was replacing after my galaxy 3 was taken without my consent! I really miss the g 3...anyway this phone has almost all the same features in a smaller package. It lacks a reply all when texting and has a tendency to get VERY HOT.

I love this phone! I love the price & the size. The color on the screen is great. I knew it was a good phone when my 17 and 14 year-old said they wanted one (until they got their iPhones of course). I love watching YouTube on it.

I would give it a five if it just had a front camera. This is a smart phone that is right up there with the more expensive ones. It's easy to use. I could download all my contacts from Google contacts which is always a blessing. Another really nice thing, the phone was $10 less than the AT&T web page and $30 less than the store. I had a little difficulty porting my number due to  training issues of their employees but we got it all worked out.

Amazon knows little about this phone. Neither does Best Buy. If you go to ZTE-USA you find this phone has a 1.4 Dual Core processor and a very decent resolution of 480 x 800. It even has 4G, but not LTE 4G.  This is a very nice and snappy phone that might be worth more than 99.00. Go Phone users can try this phone with confidence.  The only downside so far is that no one has yet to make any cases or screen protectors, likely because it's brand new.  In getting to appreciate this phone, I am of the learned impression that Chinese made tech gear can be really well made at a lower price and that shouldn't come as a surprise.

I've had this phone for 2 weeks. It was just released in December so it's a very new AT&T Go Phone. The specs are amazing for the price - 4g, 5mp camera with flash, fast processor, android 4.1, good battery life (beats battery life on our iPhone) , and 4&#34; screen. It is actually a ZTE Z740 phone. Call quality is excellent, Wi-Fi reception is similar to my previous iPhone, speaker is good. This is a great android phone for the price and I would highly recommend it. Had a Nokia Lumia 520 and I like this, but AT&T Radiant much better(pictures taken are much better on the Radiant also especially with the flash). The only drawback is that there are no fitted cases yet, but that's only because it is so new.

This is the pinnacle of capitalism.I'm not exaggerating. Imagine telling someone from just 50 years ago that you could have a device with which you could access all the world's knowledge or play games, could help you communicate to nearly anyone in the solar system and take pictures of them with a decent camera that you could share with everyone else in the solar system, could entertain with music, movies, or audiobooks, can track your exact location and speed using GPS while you're beating Kenyans in a street race, and most importantly of all, let you get see the latest from your favorite Internet celebrity cat. Then imagine that you tell him it only takes a couple hours of work to make the money to pay for it.This phone is the phenomenal. Of course, it's not the best phone out there--the iPhone or the Galaxy S4 take the cake on that, but unlike its predecessors (ATT Fusion 1 & 2), it actually works and it works pretty well at that. The storage and memory seem to allow you to do everything that you want to do. You can't store a billion songs on it, but you can store several audiobooks. And the keyboard is infantile compared to the Apple keyboard, but it's not a deal breaker. I dropped it once with no noticeable damage. The battery life is weak and requires charging every other day, but it's a very capable phone besides.I can maintain my Google Voice/Skype/GoPhone system and save hundreds of dollars on my phone bill every year (read my books for more on this dandy) and still accomplish everything I want. It's utter brilliance. Kudos and I look forward to the next generation!

I enjoy my AT&T Radiant (my first SMART PHONE) because I am a confident user!!! Since 5/12 (Mon), reliable & 'trouble free - clear & fast' service (voice & text w/o photo attachment) for 18 days. Even though with 1 or 2 bars out of 5 (maximum) on signal intensity, both voice & text come through without deterioration. AT&T corp. store activation, re-visited 2x for quick tips on 'how to' during the next 2 days -- great customer service each time: &#34; 2hrs on 5/12; 30 min. on 5/13; 15 min. on 5/14 &#34;. Thanks for the patience & courtesy. Shall stop by monthly & say hello. Enjoy using my own ring tones/music. Insert a microSD card, plus clean the protective lens prior to using the camera; with steady hands, the 5 MP photos are acceptable to this 'non-demanding' shutter bug (When I am in a serious photo-mood, I'll use a Canon EOS.). The 'Go Phone' plan is economical, & meets my current need. Use pre-loaded 'News & Weather' app with WiFi for limited 'current news' -- no data package required. Will add a data package later if necessary. Both 'Calender' & 'Notepad' have helped in getting things organized. This 4&#34; screen Radiant is capable and a steady performer. It could be difficult to upgrade to a more feature packed top tier cell phones with larger screen, faster chip.

First off, I'm NOT a smart phone user - if it makes a call should I be stranded on the highway and I'm good.  Disclaimer out of the way, I bought this for my Granddaughter after she destroyed her AT&T; Avail (she did it by accident).She does use smart phones and I'd put her in the 16-year-old Power User group.  She's happy with the phone.  It texts, it does Facebook (Ugh!), SnapChat (I think) and InstaGram, it plays games and it plays music, it plays Netflix, it does Google, and it takes very nice snapshots and does a good enough job with video.  And occasionally, she talks to someone.  I don't know what else kids her age do with cell phones, but she has had no complaints since she first turned it on.The screen looks good to me, but again: DISCLAIMER - I wouldn't know a good smartphone display if it was gnawing on my shin bone.  I can read the display, and half of the time I can read what's on it without my glasses.It's a good lower-medium tier phone and it will be enough phone for as long as it take her to demand more.I'd recommend it as a first smart phone, or as your next phone if your expectations are realistic.  If I ever join the Connected Universe, it would be this phone - or one very much like it - that I'd choose.

this a nice phone for the money. Seems to be very well made. No problems as of right know. I would recommened this phone to a friend.

Learing to use it. Very confused but then anything electronic confuses me. Would like a better tutorial. Phone doesn't stay on like my little flip phone. Can't tell if it's supposed to be that way or there's something wrong with the phone.

I had an HTC One X that got water damaged so I had to go back to using an old HTC Aria.  Well that one just wasn't doing the job anymore, so I purchased this phone as a replacement to use with my contract.  I've never used a GoPhone before, but it seemed the best solution and I have not been disappointed in any way.  This phone works just as well as my HTC, and although it has a few less bells and whistles, I don't need those.  The display is great, the battery lasts about a day if I'm on the phone a lot, several days with less use.  The camera is only 5mp, but it has a flash and it good natural light the pictures aren't too bad.  The call quality is good, screen response is quick, there is a decent selection of pre-loaded apps, and of course there is access to the Google play store.  There is also a micro SD slot on the side- I went to try to buy this phone at the AT&T store, and the salesman incorrectly told me it did not have one, plus it cost $20 more.  Very happy with this Amazon purchase.  The only problem occurred with late delivery.  UPS Surepost tried to hand it off to the post office at 4 am, and of course it was closed.  I ended up receiving it about 5 days late.

Needed to get some new cell phones for the kids that we wouldn't need to worry about.  For the price, it is a great phone.  The camera, while not cutting edge, is plenty good enough for their uses.  The touchscreen and the UI work great and there are quite a few installed apps on it already, but the google play store has more.  This phone also has wifi and 4G.  The battery seems to last all day and the screen is plenty bright for indoors.  It's probably not bright enough for a sunny day though.  Would recommend.

Camera quality is not great, but for $75 dollars or so its a good phone.  I had the HTC Vivid previously, this is a step down in terms of camera quality, but everything else is the same on this android phone.  I am pleased with it and if it last me a year I will feel I got my money's worth.

Nice size phone pretty easy to use, good first &#34;smart phone&#34;.Only thing I do not like about it and would have made me not buy it if I'd known ahead of time, is it has no &#34;reminder&#34; tones that keep ringing to let you know you have a text / voice mail you haven't seen / heard yet. So you have to keep checking it BIG dissatisfier for me.

I've had this phone for 4 months. It was just released in December so it's a very new AT&T; Go Phone. The specs are amazing for the price - 4g, 5mp camera with flash, fast processor, android 4.1, good battery life (beats battery life on our iPhone) , and 4&#34; screen. It is actually a ZTE Z740 phone. Call quality is excellent, Wi-Fi reception is similar to my previous iPhone, speaker is good. This is a great android phone for the price and I would highly recommend it. Had a Nokia Lumia 520 and I like this, but AT&T; Radiant much better(pictures taken are much better on the Radiant also especially with the flash). The only drawback is that there are no fitted cases yet, but that's only because it is so new.although i paid $69.99 i would say its worth $99.99

I've only had the phone a few days and I really like it. I had the Avail go phone and hated it. This phone works a lot better. I can't see paying $600 for a phone. This phone is perfect for me.I really like the talking text feature because my son only communicates through texts.

Great experience for my 1st smartphone

This phone performs well for talk and texting.  I especially like the speech-to-text performance.  The only downside I've noticed is that it is a little large and heavier than comparable screen size phones.  But of course those phones cost 2X-4X the price!

This phone is well worth its money. I had a Nokia 1020 which retailed at nearly $600 , I liked it as it was a windows cell phone. Even so the Radiant was only 70 plus dollars it really does as much except having a 41 million mega pixel camera. I would never buy a expensive cell again as the Radiant is a very good phone for the price and it comes with lots of downloadable apps

This is a knockoff type phone but is very much worth the price and preforms really well.  It works as well as phones and 3X the cost.

AT&T was very helpful in helping to set this new phone up with my old phone sim card setting - Amazon delivered it ahead of scheduled. Also purchased protective case for it.

No bells and whistles...just the basics. No front camera if you are into selfies...not my thing, so it's fine. Camera not the greatest...grainy pics. Ringtones boring or annoying...probably want to download some. Turned off the main vibrate button, but phone still will vibrate when I answer the phone; no, not as it is ringing, but when I answer it--weird. Decent size and weight. The only reason I bought it was it was price and ATT gsm.  Don't get reception in my house with CDMA. Will likely upgrade when I can afford it.

My HTC One X died and got it as a temporary replacement. It fits the bill.Even though it costs a fraction, the processor holds up as well.The screen is a compromise but doable.You MUST root it to move apps to the SD card, there is not enough internal storage here for heavy users.The screen is funky in angles.But overall, it gets 5 stars - the best bang for the buck.

I just received this yesterday and already it is evident what a piece of crap this phone is. It is very slow, gets stuck trying to load apps and the sd card slot is not very secure it is just a little flap that goes over the slot. On top of that, the sd card slot does not lock the sd card in, it requires the slot to be shut, which does not happen because the piece of garbage phone has one of those flaps you see over charging ports for some reason. I know this a cheap phone I am just using until my upgrade kicks in but I have had cheap phones and they were not this bad. I dont know if i will return it because i got rid of the old phone and now i will be without a phone. Hopefully they will send me out a new phone with return postage paid to send this crap back. I also hope they will give me a better phone because I dont think I even want this phone again. Do not buy!!!!!!! Even if you are used to cheap phones do not buy this. The cheap nokia windows phone they have is better I just dont want windows platform phone, too used to android. AGAIN THIS PHONE IS A GIANT PIECE OF SH@!

Got one for $60 . It is a basic phone  and okay for the price.  Oddly, there are no fitted cases available.

I'm really pleased with my new phone purchase:)  This is my first smart phone... I've had it for a month now & it's been really fun exploring all the various features & apps.Any questions or issues that I've had, I simply called At&t;'s customer service & they addressed them.So far, it's all good:)

So far this phone has been online and active for 590 hours, not one glitch, not one problem.  Its fast, reliable, has good sound, and the pics it takes, while not high-end, are adequate.  In fact, I can't think of one bad thing to say about this phone.  Its well worth the money, whether you pay 75 dollars, or 99 dollars.

Well I ordered 3 of these phones and was happy with them until the phone that my Father ended up with went HAYWIRE! The screen would lock up and go completely white. The only way to shut it down on several occasions was to pull the battery out. Thank goodness this happened right away, while it was still under the Manufactures Warranty as this phone was returned (with no problems I might add from Amazon). Then other two phones are working flawlessly and both of my Parents ( I gave my phone to my dad and sent his back) are happy with them. I am reluctant to give a higher rating based on the knowledge of the past trouble we had with the bad one. I my self will most likely be looking for an I phone.

Save money, enjoy the finer things a smart phone has to offer. The AT&T radiant is that phone. I did not want to pay a car note for a nice phone...Radiant is just that: a radiant phone to enjoy, appreciate, and brag about. I am really enjoying mines

Brought this for my wife, it's her 1st smart phone, she is very satisfied. Good smart phone to begin with, easy to operate.

Does not feel cheap, fast dual core, decent 5 Mp camera lots of storage space for regular user, loud external speaker and headset, good reception, SD card slot and battery life of ~2 days with intermediate use.

The phone is delivers fast texts, the graphics on the games look nice and clear and the battery life and the price are great.

Battery life is very limited.  Still learning my way around it however, once I get used to it I think it will serve my needs.

No forward facing camera. Bluetooth doesn't sync with my fit bit. And it doesn't handle multimedia text messaging like a true smart phone (when you message several people out when someone messages you and several other people, it does all the messages in individual threads). Still,  the phone is good for what you're paying for. $80 and I have a phone with internet, Bluetooth to sync phone calls to my car. I'm pleased all though not impressed.
