I do not speak or write in English but good phone, it works without problems, was scheduled with the operator Movistar Venezuela without any inconvenience. the only thing is that the case did not come as part of the accessories that included the supply and the back cover is used.

i've seen some people reviewing problems with this products. I didnt have any! it is unlocked (i am using it in brazil), it is not refurbished, and the price is great. cant complain.

I initially purchased this device in 2008 from AT&T when it just came out and changed 3 of them since that time. First had a problem with trackball after couple of months of use. The other one had dead pixels on the screen. So I am on my third device now.  My primary aim for this device is usage of chat software(IM+), emails and internet browsing (Opera Mini). This is by far is one of the best and user friendly devices I have used. It is not laggy as windows mobile devices, The menus can be accessed quickly with no delays. And especially multitasking (which iphone lacks) is a very nice feature that has been helping me a lot while chatting, making a phone call, and watching a video or listening to the music at the same time. Of course I had to update it with the latest firmware update. Before that, I had some java errors and spontaneous reboots, but not anymore. Since the last update I can confirm that I had NO problems whatsoever. I have few complaints though which in my opinion are minor ones and I can live with them. First is the battery life. If I am not using internet very often it may last a day and a half but when I am browsing with Opera Mini or chatting on IM+ the battery drains very quickly so I have to carry another battery with me. Another thing I would prefer to have is a nice youtube player which I can't find anywhere (I tryed a couple of them). And the youtube that plays with a native browser is just garbage, which is kind of sad because other phones like Iphone and HTC touch pro 2 can play youtube quite nicely. And last but not least is the camera. Outdoors, on the bright light you can get more or less decent pictures but if you will try to shoot a video it will come out as a total crap, pixelated with distorted lighting. And the flash isn't helping much either. Unlike for example with Nokia n97 which takes pretty decent pictures and videos. But like I said these things are minor ones and since this phone is being oriented more for a business user you can't expect to have it all. Especially I like the ability to operate this device with one hand only, which comes in handy in many situations, unlike some other phones with larger keyboards I have tried. Of course another nice feature is a multilanguage support which you can not have in windows mobile phones (e.g. convert device and keyboard interface in spanish, german or other language at no charge) Now I am only expecting the release of OS 5.0 which I will immediately install on my device. So let's see how that goes. I definitely recommend Blackberry Bold for someone who is searching for a device with push email, chatting and light internet use.

these phones are no good and there was no warranty on them, i bought these for resale i lost out on these phones

Please do not buy this! Doesn't work international! Total waste of money!!!Please trust all of the negative reviews that you see on this site!

no me gustaron me llegaron da&ntilde;ados y no los pude devolver me puse en contacto con el vendedor y no me respondio

I only had it for a while (read a day) and was pretty impressed with the product. You can look up alot of good reviews regarding the phone so I won't burden you with details.The shipping was fast (I got lucky on that) and everything came in working order.They did leave out a few things: no headphones and no USB connection for computers which would mean extra work for the buyer so keep that in mind. They did send a wall charger though. Also came with a instruction booklet that was barely readable. Oh well, I don't use it anyway.That being said, the phone they sent me was an AT&T; optimized phone. If you're carrier doesn't operate on SIM cards, don't buy this! I run through sprint and they had to give me the bad news. Well, c'est la vie. Great phone over all!

The product is published as new and was sent used, good timing on contacting back but not very good in compansating loss.

This BlackBerry is plain AWSOME! I won't get into all the specs since other reviews have done so.  I do have the need to point out, however, that the phone appears to come from a german-speaking country, and as a result the user's guide and phone are in german (so you'll have to walk yourself through the german menu in order to change the language)....also because of this, the Z and Y keys are switched (it's not a phone flaw, it's a QWERTZ layout since in german they use the "z" more than the "y", and also because many german words end in "tz").... that aside, it's a great buy and one you can't go wrong with! Enjoy!

5 stars for you my friend... the cellphone arrived in perfect conditions and with all his accesories... I hope make another purchases in the future!!

good I have a problem with the order I, RIM Blackberry Bold 9000 (Unlocked) - Black does not arrive to the address listed intended need to know if you have any other order that I can find the product thank you very much

I bought this phone for NEW but discovered it was refurbished. I was told this when I took the phone to repair it two month after buying it. The phone was rusty inside though its casing looked new. I was told that, given the condition of the phone, it was likely to stop working at any time.I strongly discouraged the purchase of this product.

I resend the phone for change and return another bad also. and not received more answer about this.  Dont buy this item, is refurbished but down quality.

Excelente smartphone,con un sonido inigualable para estaciones de radio y el speaker(manos libres).Es para ejecutivos con buen desempe&ntilde;o.Lo recomiendo para trabajo,no para juguete.

This phone is amazing! Juzer at TriStar is an awesome rep to work with. Totally beats my iPhone 3G.Screen is totally gorgeous. Keys are no different than my 8320, very easy to get used to. 3G signal is kind of flaky, but I read on forums that it'll be fixed in the new firmware. UMA works like a charm, and the phone is FAST!Anyways, thanks for everything Juzer.Shaundra G.

i like the phone very much it was new when i got it. described very well from the seller i was very happy

the firs one shepped fast and its ok no matters but the second one shepped was bad and the phone doesn't work perfectly

Good camera with flash, good battery, the language only english.The phone stamp a logo AT&T; and startup/shutdown same.In general it's ok.

I got it on time. It was new,worked just fine and was unlocked like the description stated. No complaints here!!

The phone works fine, the issue came from my current phone service having to interact with another manufacture and carrier's device. I couldn't download apps or use internet services. Just the phone and text messages. I had to contact Blackberry for an additional $45.00 so my new phone could be updated to it's current network. So before purchasing any device always ask if the device is updated as well as unblocked. I learned something through this.

Ilike this phone ,but first time when i got .its working and everything is good .i thrown out the box qnd book it came with it ,i thought is ok ,but second it doesnt work i dont why and im trying to return but i dont know how bec i have no box and books , its bad

Very good the Blackberry Bold 9000, came with all the above, although not original or battery or charger, but it works.

Bought this for a friend. Haven't heard any issues with it. Really was unlocked. Came with extra battery, USB cord and charger attachment.

The phone will not charge at all I tried several charges and internet doesn't work plus I can't get anyone on the phone to help me with this so its going back and I may contact the BBB as well

It's a nice smart phone.This is a great feature on any smart phone.The screen size and brightness and the easy scroll wheel make navigating sites easy. Also the qwerty keyboard makes it possible to actually type into boxes or searches so as to make the internet accessible.Cons:Somewhat large.Poor battery life.

I received the phone and it looked great. I has slight issue with the screen but I looked past it... Bas mistake.  Since I have had the phone I have had numerous issues from charging the unit to the memory.  I could go into detail but the point is I hate the phone now and I can;t return it. That's my fault of course and I'll live with the phone and it kind of works. If I had a chance to do it over again I would not have kept this phone, it sucks and works horribly.

I am extremely disappointed in this product. It's the worse experience I have had since shopping with Amazon for over five years. After approximately a month, the telephone just went dead on me. Not powering on, no response, and the most disastrous thing is that it was a gift to my daughter for her birthday on November 13. I think I ought to return it, I truly believe it was a bad bad bad buy.I don't even think it deserves a single star rating

battery went bad, they buy a new one came without the manual, except for that the phone has worked well here.

I purchase this item as brand new, unlocked works internationally and right after I placed this order, the seller emailed me telling me that this product works only for AT&T and its used, isn't this stupid

I was led to believe that this was a new and unlocked phone.  When I took it to Indonesia it would not work.  Was told that it was indeed a refurbished phone and not completely unlocked. I was very disappointed.

THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH A CELL FAILURE BUT BROUGHT THE SELLER DID RESOLVE REACHING AN AGREEMENT AND WAS VERY attentive at all times, FAST SHIPPING AND VERY GOOD QUALITY, I recommend it 100% I'll remember for future purchases SAFELY, VENEZUELA AND I AM VERY SATISFIED BLACKBERRY BOLD 9000,

though i know little about BB, this device is not as good as i have hoped. but the price, only can get a refurnished one with Orange Logo... With more budget, I will definitely try to get a totally new and new-style BB.

the phone is ok its a AT&T unlocked phone it must be some kind of a refurbished phone. I was expecting this all though it says it is New. so it is in New...ish condition.

excelente compre  se los recomiendo articulo de primera calidad llego en tremendas condiciiones totalmenmte nuevocon todos sus accesorios si  si

Awesome phone this is best phone i ever had, it has it all it's like a laptop in hand...

I purchased the Blackberry Bold 9000 in hopes of a great smartphone that would work out well with my prepaid phone plan. Well, this phone came in a protected package, no damage at all, worked great upon first time installing my sim card and memory card.  Contacts and all switched right over to the Blackberry from my sims card and I was able to read everything stored on my memory chip. I wanted to learn more about the phone and remembered the tutorial, then I added some free apps to the phone. With all of the adventures that I have taken this phone on I can honestly say no problems at all, great purchase for an awesome price. Very recommendable.

Okay--right up front, I'll admit it: I have been a die-hard Palm OS addict since I first purchased one of their (ancient) organizers back in the day. I resisted switching to another brand for a slew of reasons, none of which were all that valid--at least not when I look back on it now. The Palm platform was nothing if not user-friendly...I've said it before: those who designed the Palm OS simply must have assumed it would be used by simpletons who were barely above the deep-thinking of your average Neanderthal. My wife & daughter both have Blackberry Curves, and after playing with them on and off, I further refused to consider anything other than Palm because I couldn't figure it out all that quickly. But things change...but I certainly did NOT want to, I can assure you that.About 6-8 months ago, my Palm 755p began giving me trouble. It wasn't very frequent--at first...but after a few weeks of spontaneous re-starts, some at the most unwanted times, I really began to become annoyed. Working in radio, I did a live broadcast remote at a wireless location and started to seriously consider a Windows Mobile phone (in this case, it was a Moto Q9c). I began to slowly research the Moto Q and Windows Mobile phones in particular on the web and also here at amazon.com. What I discovered was other than a select few, the majority of reviews from Windows users were by and large disappointed with their phones. The common thread wasn't the quality of the phones, but the stability of the Operating System itself.This lead me to consider Blackberry...reluctantly, but a kernal of hope took root and before long, my Treo's problems put me on the fast track to getting a phone that only months before I had vowed never to purchase. I would've loved to get another Palm, but having played with the Centro, I found the keyboard actually TOO small for me to comfortably use--and I don't have big fingers, so I think that says a lot right there. I considered a Windows phone made by Palm, but gave up after reading way too many complaints about the OS screwing up way too much. The upcoming Palm Pre looks VERY promising, but my Treo simply wasn't going to last long enough, so I took the plunge.The Bold is out of the box, striking. It's wider than my Treo but MAN is it thinner by a rather large amount--nearly half I'd say.  The keyboard is quite a bit different in several ways...let me explain: some of the icons and symbols are in entirely different locations than what I had become used to with my Treo 650, 700p and subsequent 755p. I thought it would take FOREVER to get used to that, but surprisingly it didn't at all. Also, the keyboard takes advantage of the wider real estate and is spread out further...but the REAL difference (IMO) is my Palm keys were more individual and separated and way higher than on the Bold. Now THIS took some getting used to. On my Palm it was rather easy, even without looking to move my fingers from one key to the next and simply know from that touch alone that I was on a different key. This is not the case with the Bold keyboard. It bothered me--at first, but after a few days, I have become attuned to the difference and it no longer bothers me like it initially did.The next major change is the screen...and boy is this a mighty HUGE change. First off, I have become rather accustomed to using a touch-screen now for quite some time...it was one of my biggest problems with switching to Blackberry. I briefly considered the Storm, but after playing with the virtual keyboard, I ruled that out entirely. I MUST have a keyboard--the virtual one's just don't cut it for me. The other thing is the 100% Upgrade the screen turned out to be compared with the Treo. I've read about it quite a bit and I gotta tell you, until you see it yourself, words almost cannot do it justice. This screen is unbelievably brilliant. Frickin' incredible. It's a bit wider and a tad shorter than my Palm but the display certainly looked 2 to 3 times brighter and way more clear. Off the charts a MUCH better screen. I have yet to see its equal. I cannot tell you how many times I went--out of habit--to grab the stylus in order to tap it on the screen only to realize my phone no longer has one. I hear rumor that RIM is coming out with a Bold-like phone with a keyboard and touch screen...now THAT will be a phone to look out for...but back to my Bold...I'll be honest, it is quite a change switching to an Operating System so dramatically different than the moronically simple one employed by Palm. Breaking old habits seem to be harder the older I get. Where Palm was intuitive and just plain obvious, Blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out. I chalk this up to my stubborness more than anything else...but the fact remains: the OS of my Blackberry suffers in comparison to how ridiculously easy Palm phones are to use and figure out. While I am STILL working on getting used to my phone, it DOES have some nifty features NOT found in any Palm device (yet)...for instance, the one thing that sets Blackberry's apart from EVERYTHING else out there is e-mail. This certainly is one place where the Bold not only beats Palm, but embarasses it entirely. The set-up was easy enough that even my Grandma could figure it out and within less than 10 minutes, I had 4 separate e-mail accounts up and running without a hitch. Too easy and it is definitely where the Bold shines (other than the screen).The trackball also takes some getting used to. It's nice that you can adjust the sensitivity of the ball, (much like using a mouse) so if you like to scroll quickly, you can, or if you'd like a bit more control, don't worry, you can do that, too. Another place where the Bold wins hands down is the speaker. It actually has TWO separate speakers which delivers actual stereo sound, quite loudly, I might add. Another really nifty thing if you ask me. It paired up with my Bluetooth quite easily and the sound quality from what those on the other end have told me is noticeably better than on my Palm (which was notorious for having Bluetooth issues).One thing I honestly wish Blackberry did differently is allow the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time. I always figured my wife just couldn't figure it out herself for why her's never did...but as it turns out the phone will vibrate first, and THEN ring. You cannot switch it to do both simultaneously...why, I simply have no clue. The addition of WiFi is a nice added bonus. At work I can surf using the wireless network at my office, also at home and at several friends houses out in the country where service is spotty. Another major advantage over Palm...although in fairness many newer Palms have built-in WiFi...but NONE of the models I have used ever did. 3G service is pretty nice, too...but my Treo 700p and 755p were both EVDO equipped, which are essentially the same thing, so no big difference there. Downloading websites and attachments via email online is a breeze.A couple places where Blackberry can take a cue from Palm (and I realize there aren't that many) are the lack of a switch on the outside that allows you to turn off the ringer instantly without using the screen. I also wish the button to turn on the speaker during a call was situated on the screen and activated via the trackball rather than having to push the tiny $ key on front...it just seems a bit harder to find, even in the dark with the backlight on. A small annoyance, but a valid one all the same.While I have heard many complain about the clarity of the camera, I gotta tell you its WAY better than the measly 1.3 mega-pixel standard on the Palms I've used. I snapped a photo of my little son and sent it to my wife's Blackberry Curve and she wrote back wondering where I had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone. Sure it'd be nice to have a 3.2 mp camera like on the Storm and 8900, but all in all I am satisfied--especially having come from the inferior Treo camera. The video recorder is noticeably of less quality than the camera is, which strikes me a little odd, but I don't usually videotape much using my phone, so I don't really see that to be a problem for me--but you never know.All in all, I gotta admit--and while it was a LONG time in coming, the Blackberry has won me over. The lack of almost ANY advance in the Palm OS over the course of over 10 years is pretty inexcusable if you ask me. Seriously, my original Palm organizer (no phone) looks relatively unchanged (other than color vs monochrome) from my old Treo 755p. Sure there are a few cosmetic changes in that time, but overall, the OS looks essentially exactly the same as it did from the beginning. That certainly made it easy to figure out when you upgraded over your previous model, but come ON...really? That is much too long to hold onto an outdated OS. The upcoming Pre certainly looks way cool and is an obvious 100% upgrade on the OS, but it just may be a little too late for some--it certainly was for me.If you are a die-hard Palm user frantically becoming disillusioned with your phone, its time to seriously consider moving on and putting the old away in exchange for something enirely new...just be prepared to take a while to get used to it...knowing that alone will make the conversion much easier to handle.Kudos to Blackberry on such a fine product. Conversion complete.*****UPDATE*****I am STILL working on getting used to Blackberry's entirely different Operating System. I find myself continually reaching for a stylus that isn't there, but I am slowly adjusting to a non-touch-screen phone (emphasis on s-l-o-w-l-y).The battery...? Well, let's just say as long as you have WiFi turned off, it's reasonably okay...which is to say on par with my Treo 755p...well, maybe a shade better, but not by much.The trackball...? Surfing on the Web using the trackball is MUCH less efficient than being able to use a stylus (or my finger). I find when I want to scroll down to the bottom of a particularly large page, it can seem like forever having to scroll down so slowly. I wish it were differently--and who knows? Maybe there is a work-around that I am unaware of...The e-mail set up and usage is simply FIRST RATE I have to admit. I haven't bothered to check my e-mail using my computer in several weeks now because I simply don't NEED to. I still send e-mail using my computer because even with the QWERTY keyboard, actually writing a message is still easier using a regular-sized keyboard...but I do find myself not even trying to access e-mail online much...thanks Bold!WiFi IS VERY convenient! The only minor gripe I have is that when I am in an area with less than stellar AT&T; coverage, I turn on WiFi and the phone STILL tries to use the almost non-existent signal to go online. I naturally assumed that the phone would use the strongest signal available, but as it turns out, that isn't the case. Now that I have that figured out, it's simply a case of figuring out where my signal strengths are and remember to turn off and on WiFi and phone receiver. Yes, it IS a bit of a problem, but my Alltel 755p had poor reception where my bedroom is and I was plain SOL if I wanted to check something online--at least NOW I have an option, however inconvenient it may be (I assure you, this is a minor gripe at best).The mp3 player is incredibly easy to use--unfortunately the built-in equalizer isn't all that great and the volume isn't quite what I'd like it to be--but seeing as I have managed to mis-place (lost) my Sansa Clip mp3 player, this is at least a nice alternative that otherwise wasn't available.I downloaded Transformers and Eagle Eye recently and I MUST say, this is yet one more place where the stunning screen simply SHINES beyond the competition. Add to that the fantastic stereo speakers, and watching feature-length movies in the palm of my hand couldn't be more cool & simple.I DO wish the button to turn on the speakerphone was a bit easier to locate and turn on...once again, adding a button to access the speaker ON the screen with the trackball, well that would be a giant leap forward for this device if you ask me.I am still finding it difficult to access a couple of books I downloaded using Mobi Pocket (ie I cannot access them at all), but otherwise, I am still impressed and VERY happy.

I HAVE A NEW IN BOX AT&T; BLACK BERRY BOLD NEVER USE STAY IN BOX PHONE COME WITH EVERYTHING IN THE BOX YOU NAME ITI NEED TO GET MY TEXT BOOK ASAPCOME WITHPHONEBATTERYCHARGERMANUELCDCASEAND ETC

excellent buy, the phone very well,He is quick to check e-mail, and other social networks. thank you from Maracay, VenezuelaCarmen Marina Franco

I have hade I-phones and all kinds of HTC phones and this is very simple to operate and has Microsoft office documents as well. Its one of the easiest phones to check e-mails and send them as well.

I ordered what was supposed to be a new Blackberry Bold 9000.  The first one they sent was clearly used and not working well.  The second one may or may not be new but it was made for Vodaphone in Denmark.  It works sort of ok on T-Mobile (I told seller it would be connected to T Mobile) but the software is some non-authorized version that BB does not support and cannot upgrade.  The result is some funky outages and an inability to fully synch email, calendar and contacts.  So it works as a phone with some aps, but not as fully as it would if had been made for T mobile or ATT.  Buyer beware of these cell phone suppliers.

el producto con defecto,  se da&ntilde;o a los tres dias de uso, la topa tracera no cierra. y pedi un producto nuevo y este no lo es. y no trajo papeles de compra. no estoy conforme.

I made the mistake of purchasing the RIM blackberry 9000 from Cell Lounge, a retailer on Amazon: My biggest shooping mistake.The first phone sent to me wouldn't power up. It was obviously an old phone, with a rusty earphone port, old battery and broken headset. Very dirty looking phone.I was amazed that I was sent a used phone, because nowhere on the advert was this stated.I mailed the phone back and subsequently got a replacement. This one at least  powered up, but the track ball, green speak button and red power buttons didn't work. Also it was a used phone with an old battery and very dirty inside.This is really not a review of The BB 9000, but a review of Cell Lounge.People: AVOID CELL LOUNGE LIKE A PLAGUE.I trust Amazon implicitly and generally look nowhere when it comes to shopping online, but Cell Lounge and others like it will ultimately destroy Amazon's reputaTion if this keeps up.

I  bought it used but.... I only used it few months because does not functioned anymore, it seems like dead. don't accept reparation .to bad! sorry!

I've been using Blackberries since a blackberry was thought to be something you would find in a muffin. The 8800 was the one I was using until I was given the Bold and, up until then, I thought of it as the best Blackberry ever. Then, the Bold came and it is probably safe to state that the Bold is now the last and the best classic Blackberry ever because the Storm, lacking a physical keyboard, probably deserves its own class.When the Bold and the 8800 are placed next to each other, what's striking is the similarities between the 2. The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away. The Bold, with its high resolution screen and the same solid, functional build is a good tool, now with more 'fun' stuff (camera, video playing) added to it.

excelente equipo creo mi unica queja seria que la pila le dura poco al rededor de 6 horas segun es normal para el sistema de estos equipos. del resto todo bien

Great phone...However with a snag or two. Name recognition suddenly stops working and you have to remove battery so that it starts working again. I had the BB 8300 and it was flawless. The software was just real solid. RIM should have something soon to fix the software snags.I love all the bells and whistles (Add-ons) it comes with, you can download themes that make it look just like an iPhone, but obviously with BB functionality. A must buy.

...experience I am having since the invention of cellular phones. I am trying to switch from Verizon, unfortunately, because daughter wants the Blackberry Bold, which is available only with AT&T.; So I am going through this horrible experience. I believe I am entitled to write this under this product because you cannot get this phone unless you get the terrible service together from AT&T;, so in my view the phone and the service go together.That said, here is the rest of my predicament.I have received the three phones under a family plan for almost two weeks now (recd March 30th, today is April 12th). I am with a company which has a discounted plan with AT&T; for its employees so I have to call AT&T;'s Premier Support for activation. And if this is AT&T;'s 'premier' support I cannot even imagine what their non-premier support is like.I am in Mountain time. AT&T;'s 'premier' support closes at 9PM EST each weekday, so I've been trying to get home in time to try them between 5-7 PM my time, so that our phones don't get cutoff mid-day.Each time, I go through half a dozen prompts to end up in a waiting queue, then after 10-15 minutes I hear a couple of rings like I'm getting into someone's phone, but instead I hear a click and the line goes dead.Been going through this all past two weeks. Was then looking to the weekend when the 'support' would have more overlap with my time zone.Saturday, I start calling at 9AM MST and lo and behold now after the last prompt I'm thrown into a voice mail to leave my number for a call back.I leave my home number because I don't want to call on a line which will be deactivated, so I get stuck with my home phone. Half of Saturday goes by then I try again, leave another voice mail. Did I get a call back? You guessed..  Sunday, same thing..Then, I looked up and tried a different support number to perhaps get to a supervisor. I go through several prompts then I get an announcement 'sorry, we are having technical difficulties' and the line goes dead.I am now trying to convince my daughter that quality of support is more important than a phone and I have absolutely no desire to get stuck with inaccessible support and a terrible company for two years, no matter how good the phone may be.Have been with Verizon for 10 years. Can call their one number anytime and talk to them about anything, changing plan, my company discount, anything, all in one place. And have never waited more than five minutes on line to talk to someone.You can draw your own conclusions....

realice la compra de dos equipos uno de ellos funciona a la perfecci&oacute;n el otro uno de ellos funciona a la perfecci&oacute;n y lo utiliza my wife mientras que el otro presenta sistema orange este aparato no cierra la tapa trasera del tel&eacute;fono es decir la de la bateria,  a los tres d&iacute;as de recibirlo deb&iacute; enviarlo a reparar debido  a que dejo de funcionar parte del teclado el telefono funciona 3G por la banda 1900 lo cual solo deja la opcion de movistar o movilnet.claro estoy en venezuela de ptonto en otro pais funcione con otras operadoras.

Bought 3 of these phones one for my dad and one for each of my 2 older sisters. They really like the phones.

I received this phone and immediately placed my sim inside.Pros: The phone is fully unlockedCons: The phone does not activate the data plan on my SIM.  The sim and plan works perfectly on my BB Tour.The ear speaker does not work.  I do not hear anything when the phone is place to the ear.  I can however, make calls and hear with the loudspeaker.The volume button does not function.I am very disappointed as, this is supposed to be a brand new phone.I think that I'll take in the phone to a repair shop as returning it to Amazon is not a viable option.... I am in South America.

The phone was unlocked from O2 Network, so that is why the keys are switched. Other thoughts: its fast, its beautiful, its a bit big, but I love it, so I really don't care about that.'Activation from my network was done un about 2 hours and everything is working perfectly.

The good, the phone is good, the 3G speed is excellent.The downside: wine-phone, without cover, the magazine that brought was burned and the battery is not original, very hot.

Great Buy met all my espectations very good deal  it did arrive on time  the phone was a great phone

el dia 14-01-2011 realice un compra por este medio de un Blackberry Bold 9000 con estatu nuevo (EL CUAL ES USADO)por el monto de 309$ el cual me fue entregado, pero con el inconveniente que al tratar de activarlo ante la operadora telef&oacute;nica movistar, no se pudo realizar, ya que manifiesta que el equipo en cuestion se ENCUENTRA REPORTADO COMO ROBADO, por lo que no puede ser utilizado.

I am writing to inform me that you can do in this case because the operator informed me that they can fix the situation are those who sold the computer, so you can eliminate the aforementioned report.Waiting for a prompt response and solution. (indicate whether the equipment can be returned)NOTE: it is given a prompt solution to this request, I shall see the need to denounce this electronic medium and buyers through amazon for the scam that buyers are being sold used equipment as new and repodertes of stolen

The equipment works well. The problem is that it does not work on 3G in Venezuela. Not recommended for those who wish to work in 3G.

Producto en perfecto estado, gente responsable, satisfecha con mi compra, recib&iacute; exactamente lo que ped&iacute;, funciona perfectamente en mi pa&iacute;s Venezuela, no trae tarjeta de memoria pero eso no me preocupa no es gran cosa ya que ac&aacute; la consigo super econ&oacute;mica y la consigo f&aacute;cilmente...

**WARNING** WARNING**  WARNING** WARNING** WARNING** WARNING**FIRST, the phone took more than the stated shipping time to arrive.  In fact, it wasn't even shipped until after the estimated arrival time.SECOND, while the phone stated it was "unlocked" it was an AT&T; phone.  Many of the features that originally attracted me to the phone didn't work with my carrier because they were exclusive to AT&T.;  We spent hours and hours trying to get it to work.THIRD, the screen periodically turned to sections of colored lines, making it impossible to see.  Even removing the battery didn't re-set the screen.  While it could make and receive calls (assuming one had everything programmed in speed dial and the speed dial buttons memorized) the screen was rendered useless essentially making the phone useless.FOURTH, returning the item proved a challenge that took over 10 days of my time.  The vendor has an answering machine that doesn't take messages and emailing them as the instruction state has yet (over a month later) to warrant a response.  When I did get a live person to get the return arrange (remember, you can't return an item without speaking to the directly first) the person argued with me when I said I just wanted my money back and not a replacement phone that still didn't work with my carrier!FIFTH, the phone is big and bulky.  The Blackberry I did get, which does work with my carrier, is half the size.NEVER AGAIN!

solid phone best of the blackberry.  I had this phone for over 6 years and I have not had one problem.

I ordered this phone for a present. The phone is just as described and works great! The phone does not have Spanish language installed, only English but it was easy to install from the RIM web site.
