wonderful phone, really nice and easy, well contruction also, i certanly recommend it, and the price is very good too.

This phone over exploted my expectations! It's beautiful in every way and it's only 250 bucks!! I compared it with a S3 and a S4 and it kicks the s3's butt, and it's almost the same with the s4! The thing about this Blu cellphones is that they do not apply much patches to the system so it does not have the stupid features the galaxies have... So yeah, if you are thinking about it... JUST DO IT!

The package arrived on  time and well done packed, but surprise.... Two phones in same package - one for me, one for my girlfriend. One with all accesories including screen protector and back silicon case and one without headphones, screen protector and back silicon case. And guess what? The incomplete ones I gave as a gift to my girlfriend... She's really dispointed, I am disapointed and I don't know what to believe... The phone are really well done, looking amazing and has good performance, but to deliver the case without small things that makes the big story... I order by now 5 different BLU phones, all in the top, and all of them comes in good conditions and my rellative for which I order them are very happy.. For this reason I give them 3 stars... I am still waiting for a reponse from technical support. At least now we can identify which phone belongs to who - one with case, one without :)

The Blu Life One is a surprising phone.I didn't have very high expectations for it, to be honest. But at just over 200$, this phone really does perform as well as the high end ones on the market. It might not have as sharp of a screen, but it accomplishes any tasks admirably. I've had it for a few days now with absolutely no issues. The version of Android it offers doesn't seem to give me any problems.The battery life is so-so, but it's what you expect with any smartphone now.Overall, if you want a quality smartphone without locking yourself down to a contract or spending over 600 dollars, consider this device.

First , this phone is big. Its like a Samsung S4 but only at a lesser price.Second Build quality is extremely good. I am an iPhone user and am pretty picky about quality. This phone will not disappoint you with either its quality or price.Third the Camera 13 megapixels is fantastic and you will not need a point and shoot camera for your local travels. I am a serious photographer and I use Canon full frame professional camera gear and lenses from Canon and Zeiss.  The camera that you get in this phone is nothing compared to the professional stuff that I have but it is definitely the best among phones that is available out there.I bought this phone for my travel overseas use and I am not dissapointed at all.Lastly: Amazon's customer service is excellent. I had an issue with another phone purchase and they handled it very efficiently and fast.

Dual sim. works great. I wish they would sell or give an extra battery for backup which are hard to find. I am sure BLU technologies will sell them to you. Very fast. 5&#34; phone. I use this on Speakout prepaid (Seven-Eleven, on Rogers network) with one sim and then the second sim is a T-mobile for when I am in the U.S. You can switch over when you arrive in the U.S. or leave both on if you wish. I also wish they would have a flipover case like the Samsung S3 and others. You remove the normal back and put on a back which has a flipover cover to protect the screen when in your pocket. However BLU does not provide one.

I've had the BLU Life One for approximately 2 months now and I'm more than satisfied.  The large screen makes viewing photos or reading emails great, and the user interface is easy to figure out.  I did have a couple of bumps along the way, mainly due to the fact that my service provider had never encountered this type of phone before so their system didn't recognize it.  The main issues encountered were with receiving MMS texts and connecting to the Internet while away from the house/WIFI.  Both of these issues were quickly resolved, however, by manually entering the provider information into my settings and rebooting the phone.The speed of the phone is great.  Pages load fast, moving between programs is no problem, and the speakers provide great volume.  I also like the fact that when you power up the phone, it doesn't have loud, obnoxious introductory music like previous phones I've had.  I know this is minor, but it bugged the hell out of me when I would power up a previous phone on a plane and scare small children.The battery life on the phone is great, even with heavy usage.  I had to charge my previous phone, an HTC, almost every day.  This phone only needs to be charged every 3-4 days.  As a bonus, charging is super fast!I've read that others were disappointed in the camera/video quality.  However, I've noticed little to no difference from this phone and previous phones I've had.The biggest downside to this phone is the color.  The Home, Back, and System buttons are hard to see since they are only backlighted, not actual buttons, and the phone is white.  However, once you get used to it, you know where they are, and they do light up as soon as the area is touched.  If they come in other colors, I'd choose any one over white due to this.Overall I think this phone is a great alternative to an iPhone.  I've had numerous people think it was an iPhone, and a couple people have become converts when I told them what I paid.  I recommend this phone without hesitation for anyone looking for a quality, phone with all the bells and whistles at an affordable price.

Product arrived in time and everything in order. Life One is great...excellent camera, big screen, low price, gorilla glass, screen protector and cover included, fast processor. I took so much time reading reviews and comparing with other phones and finally I decided to purchase this Life One by Blu. I think I made a very wise choice, don't regret it and I am very satisfied with it.

So far, I love this phone. It definitely took some getting used to but once I got used to the phone, it was great for me. What I DO NOT like about this phone is the warranty, and the warranty options from this company. There is only a 1 year warranty and the outside warranties are not that great. Hopefully this phone will continue to do its job. Also, the battery life stinks. Whatever they describe on the website as far as battery life is either a lie, or only for people who use this phone only to talk and NEVER open any apps or text. So overall I am satisfied, and it is the best phone I have ever had....just hate the battery life. I will update if anything changes.

I loved this phone and all my friends love it too...highly recommend to everyone...very high quality for very reasonable price

So far this is by far the best phone I have ever had.  Fast and light but sturdy feeling.  The included items were great.  It says you can only use a 32 GB SD card with it but you in fact use a 64 GB one.  You just have to format it on your pc to fat32 using a program (just search on google.).  I had heard a lot that the phone dims after 10 seconds but mine has not done that.  I can play pretty much all the games, even the ones Google Play says aren't compatible.  Pretty much full speed also.  The battery life isn't the greatest but just as good as any other phone I've used.  Some people take a star off for not being 1080I but 720p,  I watched HD movie on it and I don't see how anyone could tell the difference.  It looks great.  I just love it.Will update as time goes by if anything changes.

Excellent in compare to Samsung S4. Except with addition of dual SIM. Perfect size, graphics, camera, 4G. Works in North America, Caribbean with Digicel and Lime.

This is a great phone. Call quality is perfect. Killer display. Very responsive CPU, it's fast and smooth. No bloatware. Worst thing about it is not too many accessories available. Did find a good case on this site, so very happy. Excellent purchase.

Cool Phone Works Great Takes Great Pictures, the onlydownside like most phone Battery does not go to long tobe honest i really think it might be very close if not betterthan the higher priced phones.!! try it you will like it if not justreturn it!!

This phone is pretty decent but as one other reviewer said, the screen dims after about 10 seconds automatically.  It doesn't shut off, just dims.  When you are reading or doing things it is really annoying.  I find myself having to touch the screen somewhere to get the screen to come back up to full brightness, and then I sometimes hit an icon and it launches something that I did not want.  As far as I can tell there is no way to change this, and so far no apps I have downloaded have been able to correct it.  If this can't be fixed I will probably return it.  I have an email in to Bluproducts to see if they have a fix for it.

good morning, Product arrived on time and everything in order. A life is great ... big screen, low price, gorilla glass, screen and cover included, fast processor. I have no regrets and am very pleased with it. Wear a week with one blu phone life (gray), the only problem I have is, the main camera takes pictures (camera 13 mp) with noise. could someone tell me how I can help solve or to leave me sharp pictures.

Sometimes I feel like I can obviously tell the screen quality isn't as good as my old phone (LG Optimus M+), one video it wouldn't even play because apparently the phone's resolution wasn't high enough or something. This phone is also just a tad more expensive then my old phone. But I still feel that I completely got what I paid for, & its totally recommendable. While I was at Walmart today getting it activated through straight talk, I compared the size difference between this & the S4 & S5. I didn't really pay attention to screen size difference, but the phone as a whole is just a tad longer than the Galaxies. Also a bit wider too, but I think that's what makes it feel so durable. It also has the metal surrounding the edges just like a Galaxy. I think I literally bought the knock off of an S4/S5 & its worth every penny. If you search for cases on Amazon, they actually have an okay selection. Though the phone comes with a gray flimsy case, I wanted some bling for such a beautifully made phone.ALSO, if you're getting this phone for straight talk & do an AT&T; sim card, I can help you set up the CORRECT APN settings. What the store & website gave me didn't work. So I took it upon myself to dig into some research. The phone service worked immediately, without adjusting anything, & MMS is what was so hard to figure out.To get to your APN settings: menu>system settings>wireless & networks>more...>mobile networks>access point namesNow, it won't let me delete the original APN, so I did menu>new APNHere is what you type in!Name: Straight Talk (whatever you want really)APN: tfdataAPN type: default,mms,suplProxy: Not setPort: 80Username: Not setPassword: Not setServer: Not setMMSC: [...]MMS proxy: 66.209.11.33MMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: PAPAPN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4APN enable/disable: check (make sure you uncheck this on the original APN)Bearer: UnspecifiedHope I helped! It had me ticked off for quite a few hours.

This is my first smart phone and I compared it to others like Samsung in which everyone has one so I didn't want to be like everyone else. I like BLU it's something about this phone and it "ROCK". Just hope it do not break or go out because it's a very nice phone!!! One of the best thing about this phone is the big size screen and the colors of the pictures, that's good technology. My wife Samsung don't produce like this BLU. So far I love this phone.It has been over a few months now and this phone gets better as I learn it's functions.This phone is amazing. My friends seen my phone and said this is really a good phone and went out the following week and purchase the new Samsung 4 or 5 phone with the upgraded technology feathers. They just had to out do me but that's okay my BLU is better for the price and I don't have a plan. "GREAT WORK BLU"

This is the best phone that I have ever got, amazing features and nice look and performance, it have a big memory capaticity and the camera is faboulus with his 13 Megapixeles,, I really recommend this cellphone to anyone

This phone is awesome. I haven't felt this good about a purchase for a long time.Why 4 stars? I do not like the fact that they put the camera shutter right beside the switch to video button. They should have put a separate button that allows you to switch from camera to video mode, and leave the shutter button alone.Too many times I click on the shutter, just to find that it's recording a video. By the time I realize it the moment I wanted to capture has passed.Major annoyance.Other than that, I have nothing to complain about this phone.June 24 update:I had to remove another star because the volume is really really bad. Unless you're using the phone in a completely closed and completely quiet place, you can't hear much. I have never had to set the volume to the highest level on any of my devices before. I guess you could use earphones, but I feel like this being a phone first and foremost, call quality should be good with no external help.Hopefully they can send a software update that can improve the volume/speakers, but I doubt it.June 26, 2014I had to come back and change rating to 4 stars again. This phone has the best battery life out of the box. I didn't do any settings, tweaking or battery saver app installed. So I'm impressed. I decided to put the 2 above mentioned problems under minus 1 star instead of minus 2.PS: I love the face unlock feature as well. Good job Blu!

the phone is very responsive, and easy to setup to my preferences, good device. and recommended Seller

Great phone if you do not want to spend so much money on a Samsung galaxy, however although the camera is 13MP, the quality of the pictures are still not as good as the Samsung Galaxy phone.

The phone is working well (especially for the price) when it is working :-) The issue I have is that sometimes certain buttons does not respond. The most common example is when I am using voicemail - I can dial number but I could not dial pass code. After few tries sometimes it start working and sometimes it does not. The strange thing is that some keys may work while other does not working on the same screen. May be I have a bad phone. I will try to contact customer service and will update this review.

Bought this phone and use it on Straight Talk. So far I could not be happier with it. It came packaged just as described on the Amazon and BLU Products site. The phone is delightfully light on the 3rd party add-ons and is 99% pure android aside from some features needed for the dual sim slots.Good:Pricefeaturesease of use/setupUser configurable primary write disk. (The phone lets you choose which disk, internal, phone or sd card to write to as primary so you can choose where to store your media, apps, music etc.)Bad:The second sim slot always showing an error if empty every time you reboot the phone is a bit annoying, but minor since the notification can be swiped away and ignored once booted up.Overall the only real complaints I have with this phone are more a function of the Straight Talk service that the phone itself. Straight Talk handles it's APN settings in a somewhat Schizophrenic way, they post on their site the settings you need to use based on phone type and phone number, but the list they post is incomplete. With out a couple of settings they don't list, MMS will NOT work on their service.Here are the settings for Straight Talk APN's I have found to work reliably with any sort of attached media:= = =Name: StraightTalkAPN: tfdataAPN Type: default,mms,wapMMSC: http(colon)//mms-tf(dot)netMMS Proxy: mms3.tracfone.comMMS Port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410APN Protocol: IPv4APN Roaming Protocol: IPv4APN Enable/Disable: Enable (Check Box)= = =More detailed information on Straight Talk APN settings here; http(colon)//t(dot)co/qd0ybr4rfaBe sure to delete/disable all other APN sets after inputting, saving and activating this one.Overall I have had a very good experience with this phone and with BLU Products and will be buying my next phone from them in the future. I highly recommend this as a budget conscience alternative to the bigger name brands of similar spec/features.Very good product, good price and excellent service from seller BLUTek USA~Edited to correct links since Amazon won't let us post links, even if relevant.

Fast Shipping! Just got my new Blu Life One L120 in 2 days ago and I love it! Everything works as stated, the look and feel of this phone is quality...not cheaply made. I'm very impressed with this phone, of course I've only had it for 2 days but it's great so far!. And you can't beat the price for what you are getting.

Phone performance and quality is good but if you want parts or support... you can as well forget BLU.I have tried to buy an extra battery  and was told by BLU support to search on Google as they do not sell retail.When you search parts for BLU Life one L120 on Google, you find NO PARTS.So.... enjoy it while it works and pray it does not break.BLU manufactures NOTING; it is made in China and their support is from order till you receive your phone. After this, forget IT!

all and all good phone compared to what i had .could not get to far from blue tooth with out speach breaking up

He seen to be happy with it, until his wife took it from him to use it for herself jajajaja

Excellent smart phone, totally worth your money. Compare to iPhone and Galaxy, this is a great buy for it does most thing like both iPhone and Galaxy

Nice phone with great screen size and resolution.  The problem is that the screen dims in 5 seconds after being activated.  Blu is supposed to be working on an update/correction for that, but as of yet it is really annoying.  It boggles my mind that they would release a product with that fault.

Phone arrived later than the estimated time but that was because usps wasnt running yesterday (memorial day) my fault for not checking  before I added express shipping. Even still im very very very happy with this phone and the look and feel of it. It is gorgeous and the advertising pic does it no justice. It is a good size phone but feels very good in the hand. Used it to switch over to tmobile from boost mobile. Very satisfied customer!

This phone exceeded my expectation of  a budget phone. I was really hesitant at first but after all the positive reviews and the few that were negative were really trivial issues, I bought the ONE. It's dual sim and does almost everything that the other high end phones do. Everything about the phone feels premium and even the case is better than I thought it would be. Few smartphones got anywhere close to the positive ratio of 5 stars to 1 stars which that BLU LIFE ONE holds. If you're looking for a good quality reasonably priced  smartphone that has dual sim, go for it.

was a good and secure purchase, thank you very much I love my phone, everything works perfectly is fast and very beautiful .. best phone I ever had

I have had the phone for over a month and it is awesome. Worth the long wait for Amazon to get it in.Pro'sSmart with latest Android; extra fast; high resolution and super responsive gorilla touch screen; great 13 Mpx HD camera; clear sound,Con'sNo cover (cannot find anything to fit); no LTE; camera battles with bright contrast and flash pictures are grainy with little depth.Love this phone

I am not too pleased with the BLU Life One L 20. Mainly because I miss a lot of calls because the volume buttonis constantly mistakenly pressed. Also, often times the phone go silent while talking.

I was looking for a new phone and I had certain criteria in mind:It had to have a modern operating system - Android or iOSIt had to have a quad core cpuit had to have more than 512mb ramit had to have a battery that could be removed unlike an iPhonefinally - It had to be AFFORDABLE and UNLOCKEDI saw this Blu Life One L120 on Amazon and started to research it.This phone has an aluminium middle housing for strength.It has a quadcore processor and 1 mb of ram.The glass is Gorilla Glass and extremely toughThe phone was ordered on April 24th and arrived on April 28th with PrimeIt came with a screen protector, a rubber case, charger, and headphones.I bought a replacement cover that I preferred, from Amazon.The phone seems well constructed, the battery cover is easy to remove and Sim card and micro SD easy to insert.I bought a Net 10 $40 per month Sim and Airtime card from Best Buy.I am using the ATT network and seem to have decent coverage, even in rural Maine.The phone came installed with Android Jelly Bean, upgradeable to Kit Kat (one of the reasons I chose this phone).I tried to update it but it seems the update to Kit Kat is available sometime in May, 2014.I've installed several apps and all seems to be working well.One of the apps I installed is called &#34;Gravity Screen&#34; - it allows me to bring the phone out of sleep mode by simply turning it over.One of the great features of this phone is Google Now which is similar to Siri.  It has many features I can send a text message or email simply by asking my phone to do it.  I can also get directions, set a reminder on my calendar and a whole host of other features.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this phone.  I initially wanted the phone to be slightly smaller but it is perfect.The screen has what seems like a much brighter, clearer image than my wife's iphone 4 s.

Have the phone for more than a month, so far its great!  No complaint. Recommanned to to my friends to buy this phone.

If your looking for a good smart phone with nice features and for half the price, go for it. The best feature is the dual sim slots. also, it has a nice 13 mp camera and big screen. The only reason I gave it 3 stars (and it's not amazon it's BLU) is that the wifi antenna is very weak, and secondly, BLU came up lately with so many different updated models that made my phone looks old.....I wish if I can return it and get the new one!!

it&#34;s a fantastic phone.price and specs.unbelievable.i feel like i have a galaxy s5 in my hands.i have this phone for about 2 months now and i have experienced absolutely no problems.great product.

i didn't know about this brand of cellular...i like for the hardware that coming, good price...great job for the people of Miami

Two reasons I purchased this phone: 1) priced reasonably 2) unlocked and 3) its a DUAL-SIM phone. That lets me combine work and personal phone into one. It also lets me travel internationally and use a local line when abroad. The phone performs great, grabs a signal in weak areas where I couldn't get one (like in my son's home, where his iPhone sort-of works, but not well, and I have no problem now. I couldn't get any signal with my old phone). The screen is crystal clear, and the 13 mp camera takes great shots.

I knocked off a star for its one weak point: It has the volume up/down switches exactly on the other side from the power switch, making it almost impossible to not mess up the ringer volume when holding it in one hand and operating the power switch. However, if you run a volume locker app, that takes care of it.Running mine on AT&T; with no problems. Very nice that it's pretty much standard Android,  without all the extra manufacturer & carrier bloat that you tend to find on the big name phones. Documentation is pretty sparse, and cases not too common also. It does come with a pretty good neoprene sleeve, but that leaves the screen exposed. They say it supports up to 32GB on an external micro sdcard, but it recognized my 64GB SanDisk with no problem. The quality for the price seems like it's excellent!

,I just got this today...I like it a lot..especially the features of this phone.. .this phone is a great deal..simply amazing..highly recommended...

I was considering other high end touch screen smart phones when a friend of mine showed me this. Mine came with screen protector, headphones, power plug AC USB adaptor, and cover. I don't know many other phones that INCLUDE all those accessories. It is light weight and the five inch screen is actually quite perfect for viewing movies. Some apps do drain the battery BUT the battery lasts anywhere from 12 hours on. I use my headphones and text a lot so depending on my activity I charge it about once a day and the charging time varies. About 60 mins for full charge. I wait until it totally dies then plug it in and let it charge. The screen is very touchy. I text more than call but the text screen has a &#34;phone&#34; button that I seem to hit on accident all the time! Otherwise this is a great phone and its compatible with Straighttalk

You get almost  everything the Samsung Galaxy S4 has for  $300 less. I've had it for 2 months with  no problems, runs smoothly and has a beautiful display. The 13mp camera is just gorgeous! Crisp, clean and clear.

BLU GIVE ME ALL I NEED....VERY VERY GOOD!!!TRUST MEYHE BEST CELLPHONE IN THE WORLD...COOL AND EXCELLENT CELLPHONE...

This phone is what i expected and more.  Everyone thinks that it is a Samsung because of the look but are amazed when i tell them it is a 1/3  of the price and totally unlocked.  I love it, first time with a full android phone so that has been a bit of an adjustment but it is awesome!  Have had it more than a month and have had no issues.  The battery life can be lacking but i think that is because i am playing with it all the time, days that i do not use it for other than talking and texting the battery life is great!

This phone does everything I had hoped, takes amazing pictures and loads super fast. I use it with straight talk, I haven't been disappointed at all. I use guide a few app's and it hasn't been a problem.

After years of using my iPhone 4, I decided it was time for an upgrade. And yes, I actually consider the Blue Life One to be an upgrade over my outdated, small-screened iPhone 4! Here's why:UNLOCKED:- This phone doesn't lock you in to a certain carrier. You have the choice of any GSM carrier. In the USA, that means either AT&T; or T-Mobile (or those who use their cell towers, such a Straight Talk, Solavei, etc). Thanks to the switch to unlocked phones, I'm paying ninety a month on a prepaid, no contract plan which offers UNLIMITED voice, text and data. Oh, and that's for TWO phones. Yes. Two phones for $90/mo unlimited everything. Can't beat it.LARGE SCREEN:- The screen is so much larger than my old iPhone! It's large without being ridiculous to hold.- The display is beautiful! The colours are vivid without being overly saturated. My husband even likes the colours on my Blu phone better than his Note II. The iPhone 4 was too dull, Note II is too saturated, but the Life One found the perfect balance that pleases the eye.DESIGN:- This phone is gorgeous. It has a sleek, high-end look to it. Slim, easy to fit in your pocket (although it is a bit long).- Lighter than the Note II but it's nearly identical in size.- Despite being on the lighter side of the scale, it gives you the impression that it's a solid phone that won't break easily (though time will tell on that one).BATTERY:- One of the things I always HATED about my iPhone was the poor battery life, and no ability to swap the battery if it got low. Now, I don't have to worry about that! Just buy a couple of spare batteries plus a wall charger and you'll never have to plug your phone in again. Just pop off the back cover and swap the dead battery for a fresh one. Farewell to my dozen iPhone chargers!CAMERA:- This phone takes some surprisingly gorgeous pictures with it's 13 MP rear-facing camera. It comes with several shooting options, as well as built-in effects and editing tools. Beautiful!- The 5MP front-facing camera makes video calls much more enjoyable! There's a lot more detail now than there was on my old iPhone.FUNCTIONALITY:- The Blue Life One actually has the ability to recognize when I'm speaking on the phone. Meaning, it doesn't BUZZZZ my skull and DIINGG my eardrums every time I get a text while on the phone (like my iPhone always did - Man, was that irritating!).- More customization options than iOS while still remaining user-friendly.- All of my favourite apps are still available through Google Play, so I don't have to miss out on anything following the switch from Apple.DUAL SIM:- If you tend to travel overseas, having that spare SIM card slot comes in handy. Or, maybe you like using two different carriers (AT&T; and T-Mobile) in order to get the best cell phone coverage while you drive across the country. In that case, you need dual SIM capability. Or, maybe you want just one phone to use two separate numbers (i.e. personal number and work number). Just use two different SIM cards and you can use two different numbers on the same phone. Spiffy.STORAGE SPACE:- Comes with 16GB of built-in storage. Not bad for a phone that's under three hundred bucks. But what's even nicer...- You can buy additional storage space, up to 64GB worth. That's 64GB + 16GB = 80GB of storage! This is something the iPhone just can't do. No comparison at all.PRICE:- An unlocked phone with a vivid 5&#34; screen and 13 MP camera for under $300... and it still plays graphic-intensive games and multi-tasks without lag? I'm proud of this bargain I found!DRAWBACKS:- The screen is actually 720p instead of 1080p. Upon close comparison to my husband's Note II, the screen does lack a bit of the crispness that his has. But on its own, it's not something you'd notice.- The back is quite slippery. If you tend to have a hard time hanging onto your phone, you might want to use the included silicone bumper.- No LTE. For me, HSPA+ speeds are perfect and seem just as fast as my husband's LTE (we're both using AT&T;'s network). HSPA+ is basically 4G. There's an interesting debate about 3G versus 4G and whether 4G actually exists... but I digress.- Minimal choices in accessories. If you're an accessory junkie, you may want to wait until more manufacturers start making accessories for Blu phones. The more people invest in Blu, the more accessories we'll start seeing become available. They're out there now but take quite a bit of hunting to track down.- 1GB RAM. I haven't noticed any performance issues, but maybe someone with a serious gaming habit would. What I do know is, this phone handles GT Racing 2 without a hitch, even with other programs running in the background. If you need more processing power, look at the new Blu Life Pure.- The speaker is pretty weak. It's also located on the back of the device, so if you set it down on its back, the speaker is easily muffled. I find this is a non-issue for me, since I rarely rely on phone speakers anyway.OVERALL IMPRESSION:- Should I get the latest iPhone? Or maybe a Samsung Galaxy S4? LG G2? This was a no-brainer for me. The Blue Life One is half the price of other &#34;flagship&#34; phones that are out there right now, while still getting the job done with flair.Well done, Blu. Keep this up and you just might have a customer for life. Especially now that you're coming out with the Blu Life Pure...

I received this phone yesterday and, so far, I love it.  It is big and bright and everything seems to be working well.  The phone seems to be solid, the camera is better than my canon - altogether a joy to use.  It came with a flexible back cover, earbuds (they also act as the FM radio antenna), usb data cable and ac/usb wall adapter.I was replacing a net10 branded smartphone and I could not transfer my service to the new sim card online but a 15 minute phone call to net10 and I was set to go.The only other hurdle was to get the APN settings right so that I could send and receive mms pictures, but there is a lot of online help for these settings (google is your friend).  This is not a blu specific problem but seems to be a carrier/unlocked phone issue.  It is working fine now.The size is fine for me - between a small smartphone and a tablet - since I don't carry a phone in my pocket.  Hopefully, in the near future, they will make cases specifically for this size phone.Very happy so far with it.Now that I have been using the phone for several weeks I just wanted to update and say that it does everything that was expected and even more!  The battery life is very good and download speeds are fast.  Like carrying a little laptop around :)

i love my new phone!!!! its better than any phone i've had.its worth the money !!! love it alot

I am very pleased with this phone. It came with screen protector, case, ear buds. I was afraid it wouldn't work with net10. Initially I couldn't get picture messages, but after messing with the APNs and changing the MMS proxy to mms2, I get pics fine.It runs pretty fast and my battery lasts a good while. I am always web browsing and using apps. It charges pretty fast too.Great phone for an affordable price. To me one of the biggest pros was being able to buy insurance for it. Now I'm covered if anything happens to it and insurance is not tied to my phone carrier.

I've used this phone for several months now, and VERY pleased with it.  I went from HTC Desire HD to this phone, having considered the Galaxy S3 and the HTC One as possible alternatives.This is a nice phone.The spec is on par with the Samsung and HTC offerings, and exceeds them in some respects, mainly the camera.It hasn't been loaded up with a ton of Android customisation, so the Android experience is pretty close to stock.The dual SIM capability is brilliant, especially if you travel out of the country.It's sturdy and the build quality is very good.I have a couple of minor quibbles, but they are minor.1.  There is a screen auto dim built in that dims the screen to 50% after a very short time, like less than 10 seconds.  When reading something on the phone, this can be annoying.  I reached out to the manufacturer on this, and it's not configurable, although they say it may be in future.2.  The power button (right side) and volume rocker (left side) should be offset.  Because of the size, you have to brace against the opposite side when using these buttons, so invariably power off when you meant to adjust volume or adjust volume when you meant to power off.Beyond those, it's perfect.  Highly recommended.

1.The packaging box was opened2.Internal memory of the phone is 8Gb not 16Gb, its false advertisement.Apart from the above things phone is Okay.

I absolutely love this phone, everything I thought plus more. Forget the outrageous price of the Samsung. You will not be sorry if you purchase this phone.

The GPS on this guy was terrible, completely unusable if you were driving, biking, or just needed to know where you were downtown. Put my sim card back into my old iphone 4S and VOILA GPS magically worked perfect again. Photos are not as clear and wonderful as they claim. Sound quality was lacking. Connectivity issues.  All around just a cheaply built phone.

This is a great phone. I had the BLU Studio 5.0 and the 13 mp back and 5mp front camera on this phone is waaay better. I like the fact that this phone has 16g of internal storage as well as a SD card slot. I like BLU phones because they are widely known across the US, come availanle with a warrenty and are affordable. The speaker phone and music speaker is not that loud and the battery life could be longer. Other then that this is a great phone for the price. I ordered this phone directly from Amazon and the service I received was phenomenal. I receive the phone in 2 days. Thanks Amazon for making me a happy customer.

This phone came yesterday and I have had a blast learning how to use it.  My first impressions are awesome!  I will edit this post after I have used it more, but so far it is screaming fast, easy to use.  Just a warning, it does NOT  come with a silicone case as shown on the YouTube video and the company does not yet have any other accessories (including extra batteries!) available.  Also, be aware it comes in an 'a' version and an 'i' version. I'm not sure what the difference is but I think it refers to which country it is meant to be sold in-USA or India??  Also, it will,only accept regular SIM cards, so if you have a micro or nano you will need an adapter

The package just came in today June 18,2014I got the phone for my mother and so she'll be the one using it most of the time. I played around with it for a few and everything seems okay. The number one reason I got this phone was because of the camera quality and b/c it has an SD card slot.Nothing bad so far.I've been doing research and for the price I think this phone is a great deal. I bought it at around $215.These were other phones I consideredBLU Life One X- a bit more bucks and has slightly better specs but based on comments the battery is built in, which is a no-no for meBLU life Pure- would have been my next option (same price range as BLU Life X). slightly better specs. no SD card, but larger memory.JULY 13,2014-UPDATEMom says the phone turns off by itself on occasions while she's on a call.

This is my first day with this phone (02/18/2014). I have only positive things to say about this phone. First, it recognized both of my simcards, one at&t; gophone $0.10/min plan and another from Telcel Mexico. I have only tested calling and texting, no data because I have not purchased data from the gophone plan. It connected to my home internet WiFi without problems. It has a storage space available of approximately 12 GB.The quality of the phone is very good and its processor is fast.The only problem is that with the protection case, you need a longer mini usb to charge the phone.

I have had several BLU phones and I must say this is my absolute favorite, in fact this may be replacing my LG G2.The phone appears much more expensive than it is, to me.  It has a great display, bright and sharp.  Nice heft in the hand with the aluminum edge and buttons, great build quality.  Doesn't seem to attract fingerprints as much as other phones, the BLU Studio 5.0 S is a fingerprint magnet!It is my first white phone, the black looks great but I wanted to be different.  Maybe that is what makes it seem so expensive, I don't know.  It is one great looking phone.Pros:Looks great, feels greatQuick and snappy, quick easy setup.Battery, at this point I can make it all day on a charge with average use.Good call quality.Lots of extras included, case, screen protector, headset.Has Smart Gestures, nice upscale feature.Cons:The capacitive buttons on the white phone are very hard to see in a normal to brightly lite area.No extras available for BLU at least in the US.  The case it comes with barely fits.The capacitive buttons are too far apart.Very few cons on this specific phone.  I have several cons for BLU phones in general, things I don't like.  The back button is on the right like Samsung, I personally prefer it on the left as I tend to use my left hand more when using the phone.  The LG G2 allows you to change the buttons to nearly any configurations, more phones should start doing that.The usb port on many, dare I say most BLU phones are on the top, not the best location if you ask me.  The Life One is one of the few with the port on the bottom, HOWEVER it is backwards compared to any phone I have ever had.  The wide side of the plug faces front and in any other device I have had the wide side faces the back.  This means that you can not use any usb charging dock at least I have not found one with that configuration or an option to change how the plug faces.All in all I think the Life One is one great phone and anyone should be happy with it.

All I can say is wow. As a non contract user this phone is brilliant. Love it. Great battery life 'perfect size.

Works fast,easy to use and tons of space over all the best unlocked phone I have used with straight talk

this is a great phone I did a lot of research found this one to be very close to the galaxy. Love the way it feels looks and sounds. I have straight talk with the gsm sims card for att get great service. The only thing I had a problem with was sending and receiving pictures when I called the customer service with Blu they were great explained everything to me so thank you, Great Android and the camera is awesome.

Generally a nice phone but it has more than its fair share of glitches. The three biggest issues I have had are: a) no matter what I have tried, I cannot send or receive attachments to texts.  I have played with the APN setting but nothing seems to work; b) the Bluetooth is very finniky. It took tons of tries with my 2012 car to get it to connect and when it finally did it only lasted a coupe of days.  It wouldn't reconnect no matter what I tried. I finally had to delete the profiles both on the car and my phone and play with it again until it reconnected.  After the third go around I finally gave up. And c) the biggie of the bunch.  I used the phone to take a hundred or so pictures on my phone on my family vacation. One day, they all went poof off of my phone.  Not a trace - into a black hole. I've tried everything to get them back but no goThe dual sims work great and were the reason I picked this model.  Unfortunately the rest of the package doesn't seem to cut it

The phone is great, no problems so far at all (had it about a week).  Excellent display and Android of course is good.  No complaints at all.  Came with cell phone cover and screen protector.  The only down side I can see is that the phone is too large to fit easily into a pocket, but I knew that when I bought it and carry a purse everywhere anyway.  I am using the phone with Wal-Mart Family Mobile, and have had no problems with that either.  The 32 gb micro SD I bought separately works well (sandisk) and I can copy files onto it without complication.  The phone I purchased is not aluminum, but appears to be a durable plastic.  Overall, wonderful functionality.

Great phone love the size! It has a decent camera but I just wish the sound could be louder with the music besides that it is a great Phone

Ive had this phone for a month or so now. So far, im happy with the camera.. takes great pictures.. My only complaint is the speaker phone.. whenever i talk on it, the person im talking to says it sounds like its hollow or like talking through a pipe.. The volume in the speakers is low also when listening to other callers.. overall, im satisfied since the battery life is good and its a lot better than my last phone.. If anyone has a solution to the speaker phone issues.. let me know.. Thx  Also, one last thing.. The phone has cut off on me twice and would not power back up when pushing the power button, also at the time i had a good charge on the battery.. i had to take the battery out to get it to turn on again.. Hope this wont continue to be a problem..

Holy cow am I impressed with this phone! I'm a pretty big tech snob, I like the customization of android, I like to root my phones and I hate hate hate bloatware (such as what samsung and LG load up their flagships with) and all the being said I adore this phone. When I first heard of these cheap, unlocked android running, lots of options phones I thought it was too good to be true, and it would end up being like those phones you get in walmart for $50 but this blew me out of the water. It has gesture controls, I was easily able to load it up with a bunch of APK customizations pulled from 4.4, it comes preloaded with a TON of ringtones and the camera is BETTER than my old LG Optimus G Pros (which I LOVED until the screen crashed). The size and weight of the phone are just perfect, not too heavy not too light. The screen is bright and crisp and responds well, the headphones are fantastic, and they look great, BTW Blu i like the ribbon wiring :P, i just overall really like this phone! My only beef is not even really with the phone, I use AT&T; and have data, and when they put the SIM card in it didnt auto retrieve the APN (access point name) to let me use that data so I had to manually find and enter in the data to be able to use any data on the phone, not too hard but a little aggrivating (especially if you are tech illiterate, i am not so its not an issue but i know a lot of people who dont even know the meaning of sim card so....)Anyhoo!  Pros: no bloatware, great price, comes with a lot of accessories, screen is crisp and clear, call quality is awesome, android 4.2 is just new enough to still have shinecons: having to manually enter APNs to use your data, not a lot of 3rd party accessories specific to the phoneoverall it competes with my LG  G Pro, my brothers samsung GS3 and my hubbys Samsung galaxy mega. I cant wait to see what they come out with next!

this phone is simply great. it is good looking sturdy and fast. ihave had no problems with it thus far. i highly recommend it. The volumn is great, picture very clear. tons of ring tones. I have had phone for awhile and it is perfect. You better get this phone before the company goes big and you will have to pay far more than $ 200 plus dollars. The phone is just as good as your well known brand name phone. Get this phone while you can you.And I donot work for this company!

The phone great no problems I have recommended  to other family members and have since bought 3 more for my daughters.

Being a re-branded Micromax Canvas 4 A210, the phone is everything you's expect - and more.Once loaded with the original Canvas 4 ROM this smartphone is one of the best of Dual SIM devices currently on the market.Only caveats:- the screen resolution could be better- the device did not come with a case and it's extremely difficult to find one that will fit.

Buy the phone looking for something that at least gets close to physically S4 (was that really wanted), and it turned out that I loved my phone. It's great, the screen is super clear, the pictures are very good, at least for me it has a very complete menu, the battery is not suuuper, but depending on usage lasts me at least 10 hours ... well, I am very comfortable with my cell and it works perfect in Venezuela

The phone is elegant, I waited months to get the it, and I can safely safe that it was worth the wait, too bad it didn't include a case (which supposed to be included according to one of the videos on their  BLU YouTube channel) also mine is developing small cracks around the camera and flash holes, and just noticed a big line that starts at the speaker hole,  according to BLU they have not received any complaints about it, so mine must be defective according to them, they promised that they will receive new back covers to start servicing the phone on November,.

This phone is good but it is now useless for me since it can not pair with my Sony smart watch 2 via bluetooth. I don't now what type of bluetooth tech. was used for this phone. Really disappointed.

Compare to the more expensive smart phones I think blu life is worth every penny,I gave it to some one &they have no complaints

it's a beauty, the scream is perfect, i love it, incredible pics, great desing, excellent connectivity with other devices, the apps from google play are wonderful, i will but it again. perfect and the storage very good. five starts for product and seller.

Mine is not connecting to straight talk. Not reading the sim. I don't know what is wrong? Any advice? Thank you

Great phone for the price

Be warned! The data cable that is currently included with the phone is defective!The first time I tried to charge the phone the cable seemed to not fit properly. The cable head would wobble in the phone's port and the charge notification would go on and off with the slightest vibration (especially if I tried to charge it in the car). At first I thought it was a problem with the phone's port. I then tried to connect the phone to my laptop. I got a notification that the device driver wasn't installed properly, which is something that rarely occurs with today's devices.After removing and reconnecting the cable about 4 to 5 times I finally got it to connect properly. The phone's memory became accessible, but not the SD card memory (I had a third party 16gb card installed). Again I thought it was an issue with the phone, so I started searching it up on the internet. I found another review on Amazon stating that the factory cable was too large for the phone and possibly damaging the connector port. I immediately unplugged the cable, and sure enough I noticed tiny flakes scraping off the inside of the port.I then borrowed my friend's Galaxy S3 cable (Micro USB, same size) and tried it. It fit perfectly, connected the phone to my laptop on one try, AND displayed both internal and SD card storage with no issues. This confirmed that the factory cable was indeed defective and/or poorly designed to begin with. I have contacted Amazon regarding the issue. They issued me a partial refund, which I found acceptable, but I am not sure whether the seller is addressing the issue yet.. As of this moment I am still using the borrowed S3 cable. If it continues to work I will get one of these cables myself to use with the phone.Apart from the above issue, the phone has worked pretty well so far. Build quality is average. The device feels solid on a whole but the side buttons are a little soft and easy to press accidentally. The display is gorgeous and voice quality is decent. Straight Talk's 3G fluctuates between 1.6 and 3.0 mbps DL and a 1 mbps UL. I've not taken enough photos to comment on the quality yet. There is an issue with sending photo attachments via MMS, but after looking it up I decided that may be related to my particular SIM card and/or Straight Talk's proxy servers. I may follow up with a more detailed review in the future.Summary: Issues with included factory cable. Either contact the seller before purchasing or hold off buying until they fix the issue. Phone is otherwise decent and a good bargain for the price.

Outstanding phone for the price. More than meets our needs. We now have a Life One and a Life Play and are very happy with both. The phone is fast & responsive with good basic features and a great display. We love our BLUs!

so far its an awesome phone, time will tell. I love the features, would recommend this phone to anyone, very good asset when travelling due to being dual sim.

Excellent all over!!!!!Best phone I have ever used!!Battery could be little bigger...One of the best phones available

Blu is not Samsung, Apple, Motorola, HTC and so buying it on cost immediately invokes comparisons with the dominant brands.But after 5 months of use, and being a previous Samsung owner, I say that the brands are overpriced and Blu delivers quality at an affordable price. There are some issues, but with an extra battery and some care, this phone is GREAT value and a recommended buy.So, some pros and cons....Build Quality- Excellent:Superb, handles scratches and falls with ease. It looks like a Samsung S4 and most people think that's what it is.Accessories - None from Blue, buy on ebay if you can find them:The box accessories are very limited. Here's where Blu USA need to get their act together. Accessories from them are non-existent to hard to get. There is a solution though: as Blu is also sold in India under the Micromax brand, I was able to search on ebay for the Micromax A210 (same model as Life One) and get some accessories sent relatively cheaply. This includes a much-needed spare battery for around $15 with shipping. I also bought a cover for the phone for around $6. All were made for the A210.  Blue should include a spare battery in the box and get rid of a very frustrating experience for Blu owners as well as empowering more after-market accessory availability in the US, at least on ebay.Battery life - Fair to Poor:Fair, but Wifi and Bluetooth use drain the battery. In all, with 2 SIMs running without wifi and/or bluetooth, you'll get about 10 hours. WIth 1 SIM running, you'll get 12 hours. With bluetooth and/or wifi, you'll get less than 8 hours. From Androids battery analysis, its the screen that chews up most of the power though, so Blu need to check that. So an extra battery definitely comes in handy although at $15, thats almost 10% of the phone price at current Amazon pricing of $217 on Prime for the phone. It takes 3-4 hours to charge the battery. Poor battery life is a feature of most smartphones though, so Blu is not alone.OS -- good, but some app pain:As Blu dont issue upgrades to the OS once the phone is shipped from factory (they say they do, but they dont), you'll be stuck with Android 4.2.1. The only issue I have with Blu's OS 4.2.1 implementation is that you cannot shift app screens around, so that if you want to move all the apps gathered at the last swipe screen to say the second swipe screen (there are only 4 screens for apps), you cant do them all together (Samsung allow it) but have to move each app individually, a major pain.Onboard memory & MicroSD cards -- good, but mSD issues:The memory is generous, but you'll need a microSD card. Beware though that saving large videos to the SD card corrupts the file integrity so any apps stored on the mSD card will be lost, as will the videos and any other pictures. The phone comes up with an error message. Best to remove the videos from the card to a PC as soon as possible. Its a pain, but you'll save your memories. The mSD corruption is a phone issue, not a mSD issue: I tried good quality mSD cards and they all experienced corruption on the Blu.Roaming & dual SIM - excellent, best feature:Fantastic: the ability the choice which SIM to use for calls or to do this automatically is great. Best feature of the phone. The multiple 3G/4G frequencies are a huge boost especially if you are on T-mobile USA which primarily uses 1900 Mhz for 3G/4G. The 2100 Mhz 3G/4G is superb for Europe, Asia and Africa where these frequencies predominate. In all, the phone will have seamless 3G/4G globally, a huge feature.Camera - excellent, but mSD issue a concern.Love the camera. Great autofocus and burst shot. Videos very good, but beware long videos being saved onto mSD slot as you may lose the video!Screen - excellent:Love the screen. Good even in sunlight.Overall Impression:Looks like a Samsung, acts better than a Samsung at 1/3 the price.BUY IT!

Overall was a great phone

Great phone!! Great Price.

I just received this cell and so far....I am greatly loving it. the slim feel.....the response to its touch. Actually this is an upgrade considering the galaxy Ace I had. The phone has nothing to envy the s4 on, maybe the ppi resolution or the processor but to me that's not a great deal. 13mp camera and 5 mp front camera, excellent pics. I am not giving it a 5 because I just don't get the software anywhere to download it to my computer and upload all my contacts.I will update this review later on with more experience with this cell

Love this phone.  Works wonderful with straightalk and I am able to download all the aps I like

the equipment works well and the screen looks great no more than to talk about the camera that sharpness is impeccable, the only thing I did not like the team is the battery life, I think to be a computer with a big screen consume more battery than normal and I walk constantly loading it. the other team is excellent.

This phone takes great pictures but thats about it. You can't use the flash though because it washes out your pictures unless you are in complete darkness.The phone will randomly close out of the message screen when I'm in the middle of typing.Service is shotty at best. I didn't think the 3g would be a big deal but it will randomly lose service all together 2 mins or so and then come back. I have T-Mobile but didn't have this issue with my old phone so I know its not the carrier.Its a new phone from a very new company and its just very sub par. Don't waste your money on this phone. I can't afford to buy another and am stuck with it for now.

OK, this will be my 5th and last Blu phone!  I'm done!  I tried, but Blu you have failed me for the last time.  This time the 3G data did NOT work at all, dead.

I went back and forth for months when it was time to upgrade to a new smart phone (did not consider iPhone) .. kept looking at the Samsung Galaxy S4 but really couldn't justify the price as I didn't want to get locked into a contract plan.  I have been buying my own phones and using Net10 for years so the purchase price of a new phone was a BIG consideration for me.  I also like to change/upgrade phones every year or so and I felt if I paid mega bucks for the Samsung I would want to keep it for several years.  My husband has the Galaxy S3 and my son the S4 and I will admit they are really nice phones but they are so worried about something happening they have them in these otter cases that make the phone so cumbersome ... something I wouldn't even want to deal with.  Anyway, I decided to give the BLU a try and boy am I happy I did.  The phone was so much better than I expected and it even came with a screen protector, nice little silicone case, & stereo headpones (which I have never used, they are still in the box).  The 13MP main and 5MP front camera work great - picks are sharp and clear.  Phone also has a very nice slim design (silicone case is so thin it's like it's not even there, but does make phone easy to grip and keeps it from slipping out of my pocket) and the 5.0&#34; touchscreen is great for someone with &#34;older&#34; eyes lol.  I do a lot of texting, checking emails, ebaying, misc shopping using my phone and love it.  I am not into the facebook, tweeting, instagramming, thing so I can't comment on that.  By IMO if you want a smartphone that seems to have many of the capabilities of a high end phone (i.e. Samsung) and aren't trying to make a &#34;statement&#34; this is a good alternative.When I drop it I don't have a heart attack because it cost $500 and it may break.  I don't have to baby it and put it in a fort knox case because I am so worried something may damage it - when it dies, or I want to replace it, I haven't broken the bank.  It also has the dual sim card feature so you can have your business line and personal line on same phone.If you are are the fence and don't want to spend a fortune go with this phone.  I think you will be happy with it.

I purchased this phone after a lot of research on every website I could find. We watched several videos on the phone and performance of the phone. We are using straight talk with an AT&T; sim card and it works great. I also picked up a 32GB sim card with the phone as well so that I could store additional music, movies, and pictures. Speaking of pictures that camera is great on the rear having 13 megapixels and 5 on the front.I did have to set up the straight talk differently front just dropping in the sim and going. Go to straight talk and put in our operating system for Android then straight talk will give you the proper settings to set up the phone to be able to receive text with pics. Also turn off your wi-fi and use the phone then turn the wi-fi back on, for some reason that worked for us on our phones.I work for a large international company and while I was sitting in the break room there were a few people in the area around me and everyone was looking at the phone. One person had a iphone 5s and the other had a Galaxy S4. I must say that the Blu life one held it's self on their level very well. Even the person with the iphone was very impressed with the one. There was actually one person standing around who was looking at the phone and he is going to purchase the Life One as well. We watch netflix, youtube and surf the web and everything runs great. I have conditioned the battery as well. I ran it down to 15% 3 times then put it on the charger for 8-10 hours with the phone off and the battery is holding very well now.  The first day the battery went very fast but I was on it alot.AGAIN way to go BLU it is a great phone.

I wanted a new phone with the latest technology.  This phone has good cameras, fast processor, nice size and shape in a competitive market.  Wonderful price.

This phone is great! Build quality more than exceeded my expectations. The 5 inch display and the phone itself is brilliant and soothing to the eyes and very elegant. Although the specs are not that of a porche, but for the 230 dollar price, i would say that this phone is an awesome value! Call quality is good, very crisp interface, and fast! I would definitely recommend this phone if you are keen on build quality, design ergonomics, and kick@$$ value!

People think what you want to about off-brand phones, but this baby is awesome. Once I conditioned the battery I usually get close to 2 full days before I need to charge it. The screen is very clear. I love it. Some people give it 4 stars because of the lack of accessories but come on people... You are rating the phone. Not the accessories. Yes, I would love to see more cases in the future besides the one that came with it but I'm sure we will. As for the phone itself, definitely a full 5 stars. It takes amazing pictures (both front and rear cam).

Being using it now for about  3 weeks and i love it don't have any problems so far, it fast and i love the display, it plays games well and video, facebook and web browsing is fluid. The only thing is that the camera record video in 3gp format and camera options are limited so i just download a camera app from the play store.Although it said 16Gb Internal Storage its only 12Gb which is formatted into two partition one 4Gb which is not accessible and 8Gb which u can store on.Other than that the phone is a great buy

I love the size and construction from aluminum, plus the 13mp camera is what I wanted to take photos of my grandson.

The phone has exceeded all of my expectations in terms of speed, features and camera quality. I recommend this phone to my friends

4G not working in USA(at&t)& France(orange)& Germany  (T mobile+Vodafone)& Saudi Arabia ( Stc+ Mobily).Even 3g and 2g not working.Please be sure before you buy.

I first purchased a Blu D530 and was pleased with it, with the main exception being that it only had 512mb of RAM, which caused certain email functions to be halted due to internal RAM demand. This also made it a struggle for normal operation of other apps competing for RAM to operate. Overall, it was a great device. To make a long story short. I visited my mother who had an IPhone 4 and she saw my Blu and was immediately impressed. I shared with her the major drawback that I had with the D530 and informed her that my plans were to go with the BLU Life One L120 and to give my wife the Blu D530. She was so eager to try a BLU that she immediately ordered the BLU Life One on Amazon and thankfully, even offered to purchase mine. We both received them today and I am  a happy, happy camper right now. The BLU One Life is a wonderful device with 1GB of RAM and 4Gb of internal storage is ample enough space for my app-intensive habit. I immediately installed my old SIM and memory card and went to downloading. No problems whatsoever! I have read about the automatic dimming in other reviews, but I haven't experienced such a problem. (maybe the manufacturer has fixed this!!) If I had any complaint with this device so far it would be these 3:1.  Finding accessories for the Life One seems at the moment to be a fruitless task. (I assume this will change as the device gains more attention.2.  It would be wiser for the manufacturer to place the on/off button at the top of the device instead on the side; they are situated directly adjacent to the volume buttons, which presents a greater probability of turning the phone off accidentally.3.  The Blu D530 came with a wonderful &#34;Theme effects&#34; app that allowed for customized screen transitions in conjunction with swipe movements. This app is not found on the BLU Life and I really enjoyed it.Other than these, I find it very difficult to see why this phone is not as popular as it is. The Blu Life One makes me feel privileged to be one person on planet Earth to be awake!

I truly enjoy this phone it's better than my old s4 ,I'm not missing nothing at all.

i have lot of hours triying to get the way to take a screen capture,  i think the only matter possible is rooting the phone , and instaling any new room, that allow you take it.  battery life is great . it least 1 day of use. (not gaming ) just calls , whatsapp , browsing, call quality is not the best,  screen is soooo soft ! :3  the power button didnt like it too much, because is very sensitive and i turn the screen off in any moment. weight is Ok...  its a little big that make the Job !

The phone itself is aesthetically pleasing, and is pretty much a GS5 clone. The camera is absolute garbage and can't focus in on anything, I even tried it on a tripod and it still stunk. You'll have to turn the phone on and off again a half dozen times for the GPS to start working. Tried it in a wide open 5 acre field at a decent elevation and it still took three reboots and an extended period of time holding it above my head for it to grab a GPS signal.Screen is big and pretty, I only wish the phone was. Also it is not standard Android OS, they put a skin on it which nullifies the majority of the new capabilities of Android OS. No Swype? Is this even an Android phone?

Phone description  about min.rated talk time (whoever provided it Amazon or manufacturer) is just misleading.Video review [...] just confirms that. You can see that In the beginning of video review battery has 87% and after 12 min - already 81%.Simple calculation shows that phone will never be able to manage Minimum Rated Talk Time 1500 minutes:12 min is 1/5 of hour...(87%-81%) x 5=30% per hour, what means phone will die in 3.5-4 hours after just surfing different applicationsThe phone I received from Amazon shows same not answering technical description results. Returned.

Great value, for the smart consumer. The phone is attractive and has all the features the more expensive phones offer. I have had mine for approximately a month and still having fun discovering new features. Blue Products has improved the quality so the complaints people had about prior phones has been resolved. The only issue at this time...accessories. Cases for this phone don't exist at this time. Ordered cases from Amazon from third party sellers had to return, what a hassle!!!! Hopefully Blu  Products will start making accessories soon. Everybody's waiting Blue so get busy!!!!!

This phone has nothing to envy to the Samsung Galaxys and with the advantage that It can handle two simultaneous telephone lines.It would be perfect if it had kitkat available.

Wonderful phone, but I can only get 3g speeds with my carrier even though the phone advertises 4g.  However I love the size, the speed, camera and everything else.  If you're not particular about your mobile data speeds, this phone may be for you.

I have had the phone now for almost 1 week and I can truly say that I am not disappointed that I made this purchase. The speed, the resolution, the photo quality and it is user friendly.Worth the money.

Love the one so far. Would give 4 but I'm still learning my phone. The battery life is short and wish it had more features.

It is great for the price. You just cannot compare with other smart phones. The 2nd SIM card does not seem to work but I might be doing something wrong.

I bought two phones at the same time. Good price and good quality. I think everything is nice, but the battery only use for two and half hours.That mean you are going to charge your phone all the time.

Battery life and GPS were terrible. This is a gorgeous phone and I would have loved to keep it, but I need GPS and good battery life.

Great phone does everything you want and you dont need to pay like 600 dollars for a Galaxy or iPhone. Man this phone is such a deal if  you on prepay like straight talk like me. It has everything a high lvl contract phone has without all the crap you get from contracts.

The phone works excellent.  I originally purchased it to use for vacation, but my Samsung 4 messed up and it was going to be used as my backup until the Samsung 5 came out.  Well, the Samsung 5 is out and I am sticking with it.  The camera takes excellent pictures.  The processing speed is great.  The internal memory is excellent.  Now for the cons:  the send button for the two sim cards should not be right next to one another!  Too much likelihood of using the wrong one.  The menu buttons at the bottom is white on a white background.  It is hard to see.

Fast, stylish & rugged. I'm very happy with it. It's an awesome phone.

Whenever someone sees my phone they ask if it is a Galaxy.  I love it!!!!! works great and the price was great.  Best of both worlds.  It works so good that my husband wants one; he currently has the Note 2 and now wants to try Blu products.  I have been telling everyone about my phone.  I love it when they ask...is that a samsung galaxy?  Nope and I didnt pay Samsungs price!

I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER HAD!!! Clear screen, easy to use and I have small hands so having a 5 inch screen was a little scary for me but I wanted it bad. I now can not imagine living life without it. I have been through phone after phone in my life and so much so that my friends/family/husband all laugh at me. I don't care now because they can all be jealous of my phone and how they wish they had one too! Mine came with a case that Blu included in the package and a screen protector as well. The cord should be longer in my opinion even though its cool because its a kink free type flat cord :) sweet! but I wish it would have been a 5-6 foot cord because yes I love to play around on the phone even while its charging (bad yes I know). The removable battery is awesome and it also has lots of ringtone options and alert tones by far the biggest selection I have ever seen on a phone and it had a little light that blinks that lets you know of a new text/call inc...That little light also stay's lite when you are charging it its red and when its fully charged it turns green :) The camera on both sides are awesome~ takes time playing around with it to get it to the right settings though but I found putting it in Night Mode setting makes for the best looking pictures. If your thinking about getting this phone and are worried because its not a &#34;name brand phone&#34; DO NOT WORRY I can assure you it ROCKS!!!! I should know being the cell phone crazy queen apparently according to my family lol (who now wishes they had one of their own lol). Hope this review helps you decide on this phone because It truly is the best phone I have ever owned and that is saying a lot!

i absolutely love this phone. It does more than i expected. It is so easy to use/see that i hardly use my tablet anymore.

Great Phone it's so much fun to use and I've been recomending it to all my friends: ) to go get one

Just got my phone last week and am already loving it. It came brand new in a sealed plastic case along with a silicone case, earbuds, charger and screen protector. The screen size and resolution are impressive. It has tons of great features like Google Now and gestures but it's not loaded with a bunch of apps that I won't ever use. I purchased a 32G memory card but it hasn't arrived yet. They recommend that you store all pictures and data on a memory card so that the internal memory can be used for apps.I have Consumer Cellular as a carrier so I just popped in my sim card and the phone and GPS worked great right away. I had to call for help to set up mobile data though. The tech at Consumer Cellular had never heard of this phone and they didn't have a protocol in their system for it but I told him that it was almost identical to the Galaxy S4 and those settings ended up working perfectly.I compared this phone to a coworker's Galaxy and there really are no visible differences. He was seriously impressed and is looking into switching plans as soon as his contract expires. Just FYI, my husband and I pay $70 (including taxes) a month for two phones with 1000 shared minutes, unlimited texts and 500MG data. We have wifi at home and at work so that is totally sufficient for us. So happy this phone worked out! I'd highly recommend it.

Phone is beautiful, neat. Performance excellent. Resolution superb. Camera the real 13mp not those for the sake of having camera.very well recommend to anyone.

There are a few things about this phone that I like and a lot I don't like.The phone itself has a nice look and feel. It has some good features like expanded memory slot,  a descent display with a good sized screen. Its nice of blu to include a screen protector and soft shell case, but the case is black and my phone is white?The phone itself runs ok, every once in a while it freezes and you have to remove the battery to reboot it, I've seen others mention this in their reviews as well.The GPS is terrible on this device it just doesn't work really. constantly rerouting when your on a 10 lane hwy heading straight, it cannot located my actual location. If I'm sitting in my house it has me 3 streets down. I've never had smart phone with a GPS this bad really.The Camera is just not that great really. the flash is completely overbearing and will ruin every picture so you have to have it turned off completely and deal with lighting so basically this phone can only take ok pictures outside. The Video from this device is worthless, pixely and crappy even when set to FINE. One of the reason's I bought this phone was for the 13 mega pixel camera and its nice that you can put a high number next to the pixel rating but not really if it doesn't work worth a damn. So kind of deceptive advertising because a 4 or 8 mega pixel camera in a older device will out perform the camera in the L120.The Wifi on this phone is not very good, I can be standing next to my house's router and get about 4 of 5 bars, if I go to the garage which is directly under my router I get 1 bar, my laptop in my garage gets 5 so yeah not that great on wifi.The service I have at&t; is good haven't really had problems with that which is the redeeming part of this phone because if it was having issues with service combined with all the other things I mentioned I would be looking for a new phone and partly I am anyways and this device just under performs in several key categories for me, that I depend on and use daily.I've also had dealings with blu costumer service as this is not my 1st blu phone and with out going into a whole lot of detail you will not be impressed lets put it that way. I know they tout the 1 year warranty ect. but what does it really cover?, not much if anything. And if you do break your phone and need repair I wish you all the luck in the world cause you are going to need it.So bring on the flames, I don't care this is my honest review after using this phone for a extended period of time not just 2 days. I can't just give 5 starts because something looks cool, when a lot of its everyday feature are questionable at best!

Has too many features to ever use them all. Perfect size. I use with straight talk and conversion was pretty seamless, with a little study needed to be able to receive data. Battery life is good unless playing games and seems to drop rather rapidly, seems to work as a phone for 3 days with 1 day a stretch if playing many games. I got this phone to read news when eating breakfast as our local paper has become 5 pages mainly national news and sports and rest adds.

beautiful. All excellent. Satisfied with the product. I love my life blu l120 is an excellent phone for its value. It's almost like having a S4. I recommend it! Super fast in Venezuela. Lift up to 4G

Excellent, nothing more to say. An excellent team, nothing to envy to the great as samsung. recommend this phone and BLU brand.

This is a good phone, however, the battery runs down very quickly. I have to recharge my phone at least twice a day. Also the WiFi connection is not very strong and I have to be pretty close to the source for a good connection. It says 16gb but I only see 8gb of free space.Presi

The phone came with a screen protector, case, and ear buds. From other reviewers this may not be true depending on who the seller is (in my case the seller was BLUTEKUSA).  I've been using it on T-mobile with consistent 4G speeds and experienced no issues (I'm in a refarmed area).  The phone can do everything that I need without the price tag of the S4, HTC one, or even Nexus 5 (when I factored in tax and shipping the Nexus 5 ballooned to $400, still a good deal, just more than I needed or wanted to spend.)I wanted to try android without spending the money for a premium phone while still getting the true experience. The phone looks and feels like a premium device and often gets mistaken for an S3 or S4.  The 5 inch screen is bright and clear, and I have had no issues with lag.  I don't play video games on my phone so I can't comment on the quality for big gamers,  I use the phone for web browsing, email, and work, for my needs there is little to no difference between this and my fiance's S4.  It is a great option for those who don't need all of the features of a premium phone but still want a quality device.

I bought it to replace a defective iPhone 4s. I did not want to be under a carrier contract and the price and features seemed right. I spent some time doing my research and ordered the phone along with a  SIM Card Tray Adapter (iCoolkit) and a 32 GB MicroSDHC. I received the phone, installed the SIM and SDHC card and had it up and running in 15 min. I was happy for 15 days but then the phone started to lock and reboot without any apparent reason. I called the BLU support line twice, and after waiting about one hour on hold (twice) I decided to try another manufacturer.

I really love this phone. Its durable, has great picture, takes great pics & processes things very quickly. I'm so happy with it. It's also light & slim for the size of screen it is. My one & only complaint is that the speaker is weak sauce. I can hardly hear it even turned up to it's highest volume. I downloaded an app that boosts sound but it's still weak. I love everything else so much that I deal with it. THANKS BLU!!!!!!!

I have been using this phone for a bit over 3 months when the bottom of the touch screen quit working, there are no crack or damage to phone and is completely unusable.

Based on the reviews, I ordered this phone as a placement of my unreliable Samsung Galaxy S-2 after more than 2 years. It is my third smartphone after iPhone 3G and Galaxy S2. Although I don't know how it compares with the latest smartphones which could cost easily in the $600-700 range without a contract, it certainly exceeds my expectation. This phone comes with everything - USB charger, a perfect fit and protective case (I happened to drop the phone once and it did protect the phone), headphone, and screen protector (which I didn't use it because it didn't completely cover the screen). Two things to consider if you are buying this phone.1. The phone is a bit heavy and big. I could notice the difference in weight and size compared to Galaxy S2 and often have to use both hands to operate. Using one hand to play around this phone could be a bit challenging.2. The specs said to support 32GB microSD. I use 64GB without any problem. Initially, the phone alerted a damaged/corrupted card. I formatted the card using the phone and the card works fine.3. Dual sim cards is definitely a plus. I have a T-mobile plan that comes with unlimited international data roaming. The phone worked without any problem when I was traveling in Costa Rica.4. The phone doesn't support LTE. I wish it did but it was not a must for me.5. They are two issues which I think the phone could be improved. One is the wifi and bluetooth. They are not as reliable and powerful as Galaxy S2. The other one is the speaker volume. It could be louder.After using it for more than a week, I am impressed by the value and performance of this phone and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I definitely would consider BLU phones in the future when I am replacing this one.

I loved this phone when I first received but as days went by it was just to hot for me to keep holding this device to my ear. After a while the phone started shutting off during my calls the battery life sucks and it just wasn't right for me overall beautiful pics it takes.

This phone far exceeded my expectations. It is beautiful inside and out. It works exceptionally and is easy to use

This phone is not perfect, but it is as close as any expensive phone I have seen.  I own a Droid 2 and an iPhone 3GS, so I will use those as comparisons.  Even an Iphone has annoying things, and I think the Blu has about the same ratio of good to bad.  In other words, this phone is great.  You have no logical reason not to buy it, unless the things I list are completely unacceptable.  Here it is, the good, the bad the ugly after 5 days of use:Good:* Gorgeous display.  Really.  People drool.  Don't let any of it fall on the phone.* Removable battery.  This is important.  Trust me on that.* Accepts 32 GB micro SD.  This gives you an easy way to transfer files if you don't have a computer handy.  Also huge storage.* Takes beautiful pictures.  Very high resolution with good color, etc.* Nice design that feels relatively sturdy, except for the thin plastic back.* Comes with a charcoal gray case that clips over the back and a screen protector sheet* Includes charger and headphones - both have tangle-resistant flat cords* Cell signal seems strong - not sure about 3G or 4G because I currently have voice only plan* The phone is fast and has not crashed yet, in 5 days of use* Battery use is acceptable, and seems like it will make it through a normal day's use* It says it has gorilla glass, which is nice, because it is easy to drop if you use it one-handed (reaching across the screen with your thumb is a challenge) - I think I am going to drill two small holes through the clip-on case and loop a piece of string through it that I can hook a finger through.Bad:* OK speaker, but not quite as loud as an iPhone 3GS or Droid2  - makes it hard to use speakerphone in a car* The WIFI is not quite as strong as the iPhone or Droid - OK, but not great* The back of the phone is thin plastic - probably the same thickness as the Droid 2, but since it is so big, it feels like it could start to break down after a lot of opening the phone* It has an FM radio, but it uses your earphones as an antenna, and the connection to the headphones keeps cutting out so that the reception is lost - minor annoyance unless you are getting this for the radio* It includes a SIM card management app, but it says &#34;not installed&#34; when you open it.  WT-?* The Sim card app is important because only the manufacturer's app can give you full management of the second SIM - The second sim still works, and you can turn it on or off and choose which things you want to use it for (sweet)* The volume is right across from the unlock button, so I keep adjusting the volume when I unlock itI would buy this phone again, and I am recommending it to all my friends.  This is a great phone.  There is no good reason I can see to spend three times as much for an unlocked no-contract Samsung.  I love it.  I feel like I pulled a fast one on the big phone makers and got away with it.  What could be better than that?

I had this phone for like 3 weeks now. Couldn't get it to connect to metropcs, went in the office the guy there said that I will have problems with it. Anyhow I bought the sim card online  from metropcs, call the customer service and get it to connect. Since using it is a descent phone got no problem with my carrier like what the guy said in the store.. My only prob was the APN settings.. Great phone for the price. Loving what I am getting from it.. Would recommend it...

first of all...i dont bought my BLU L120 here in Amazon or Ebay, I buy my BLU L120 in Best Buy its a bit high cost but its worth it!  I order online then i picked up at the store, First thing i hardly connect internet to my T-mobile account...its been 2 days i wondering i dont have internet to my Blu L120 but by checking the network settings then i found out that  i have to change the network setting to Tmobile network, then after that i have perfect connection no problem at all, i love the camera very nice, the dual function simcard its works pecfectly to me, i used tmobile to my sim1 and sim2 is my international...love it! big screen...no complain at all...the battery is so so so but its ok...the important to me is works perfectly, but the sad thing is its hard to find the BLU L120 case...

I was so sad after two weeks that my Blue LIFE L120 fell on a low leveled surface and upon pickung it up i noticed that the screen was shattered and the worst part is that it fell on its back not on the screen which made it even wierder. I would really like to get some help form the company in fixing the screen or whatever help I could get...The other features were all awesome

Im giving it 3 stars. It works fine for just your average phone. The negatives are short bluetooth range, short wifi range, and the absolute worst is the fact that they promised android 4.4 kit kat May 1st, then they promised June 1st, now saying end of June. How many times will BLU PRODUCTS put this update off??? I also bought the BLU LIFE ONE X and its the same situation. If you are wondering, go to facebook and search BLU PRODUCTS and youll see everyone else is complaining too. This is not on the seller, the phone arrived on time as advertised. I have no problem with them, its BLU themselves that keep upsetting me and a whole lot of other people. They are more into selling their newer models and forget about the people that already bought from them.

I bought the BLU life One L120 Phone for my wife's birthday. It replaced a Samsung exhilarate phone. The Samsung phone was used with Net10 service using ATT Sim card. The Samsung exhilarate phone contained some ATT blot wear Apps which seem to interfere with operating the phone. The BLU life One L120 Phone is a perfect phone to replace the Samsung phone. Samsung phone prices are just too expensive. This phone is fast and the screen resolution is gorgeous. My wife loves to look at our pictures with it.pros. 1) fast at multi-task 2) great camera even with low light 3) price 4) screen resolution 5) takes a micro 32 GB SD card 6) 4G service (HSPA shows as H+) 7) Housing is all aluminum and back snaps on with replaceable battery 8) text and pictures can be sent and received by MMS and 9) No  ATT AppsCons: 1) the phone boots up and opens up with the phone App verses home screen (annoying) 2) On Net 10 service you must guess the APN settings to send and receive pictures. They are:APN Settings:Name:NET10APN:tfdataPort:80MMSC:http://mms-tf.netMMS:mms2.tracfone.comMMS Port:80APN type = default,mms,supl

Blu Life ONE is simply Sensational. It's fast, elegant and I am very pleased with it. I do recommend it to everyone.

I Absolutely Love This Phone!!I have had no issues at all with the phone and I wanted to address a couple things.First off there is no KitKat update comming for this phone.  That's according to BLU on their Facebook page. But that's OK.  Blu did fix the problems with jellybean.No more drive partition!!!  And as far as the GPS issue I have read in other reviews that seems to be fixed as well.  It is blazing fast, it finds SATs extremely fast and is very accurate.  It works better than my TomTom and Samsung Galaxy products.This phone may look like a GS5 but its not, as long as you understand that going into it you will be very satisfied, I certainly am.  I can tell you this will not be the last Blu phone I buy!!

This phone works perfectly. I've had no issue at all. The phone itself looks and feels substantial in the hand. I'm just a little disappointed that BLU has not pushed KitKat version of Android on it yet.

This smartphone out of the gate is Brilliant! Low cost with the same great features as Big Named Smartphones!For the price you cant beat it!Of course its not a powerhouse brand but for the price it is the next best thing,"Look out competitors Blu is moving on thru"!!Just wished like "other reviews" It had better Tech support and More accessories and separate volume settings for ringer and notification volume.Works Great on Straight talk Network!I Thanks Blu for making a good quality Smartphone at a affordable price!And definitely Thanks to all the Reviewers in helping me make this decision on Buying this smartphone, you helped me out tremendously:)Amazon Thanks!  ##update 01/20/14.Still Rock'N THIS PHONE!Has it moments once in a great while like tapping the zero on the screen sometimes freezes.Not a big deal.I run this software app on Google android market called "Next 3D Launcher" "Highly Recommend getting this App". and PUH-POW it really Enhances the Home screen on this smartphone and this BLU product DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!being able to hold on its own, it works great, Hope they roll out KIT-KAT software upgrade soon on this smartphone that would be awesome!!!!I usually think of getting rid of my phones before the Grace Period is up, And trying something else.BUT let me tell you I Don't even Think of doing it This Time..Its a KEEPER!And for me to say that speaks for itself!Thanks Again BLU,I"ll catch you next year when i get another smartphone,I get one every 12 to 18 months."Please make Accessories Dam it"!! Keep the great products rolling BLU!!At affordable prices..

I bought a BLU Life One L120 unlocked Dual Sim Phone because my previous phone  a Nokia, also with dualSim was stolen. I love my BLU. it looks very much like a Samsung but it did not cost the same. I am a teacher and all my students want to see it.I am surprised that they even recognised the brand name, since I felt sure that BLU as a brand was unrated. I have to say that I have been delighted with the quality of the phone and ist varied features. It does what I want and more and the price)  though not as low as it could be (considering the quad pro phone which has similar features and is much cheaper) I am nonetheless very happy with my L 120. the one complaint I have is that the volume bar should be smaller and  positioned at a different place on the phone.Every time I turn on the phone, I manage to re- set the volume control. Perhaps this could be at the very top of  the phone.Cheers froma  happy trouper!!

I received my phone Wednesday of last week, and I must say this phone is phenomenalIt has all of the features of Samsung Galaxy 4 and much more the camera is awesome true 13 megapixlesand you can also have your pics in HD. I recently had a Samsung Note 1 (17I7) not worth the money I paid trust me.I sold it on Craigs list and got the BLU L120, all I can say is WOW it is fast, and their are so many features that I finding outabout, the phone screen is Grollia glass x 2, the display is out of this world, take if from me you will love this phone.

I love my Blue Life One It's different,haven't had any problems with my phone, works well with family Mobile. Excited

I love this phone I tell everybody about for the price I was shocked  as to how good it works it like a cheap Samsung phone

I received my phone 5/23.  Within minutes I had it up and running.  It is well made, the screen is amazing and the camera is great!  I have noticed I receive better service than I had with my Samsung.  Places that I used to drop calls (Mountains of KY) I no longer lose service.  This phone looks better than my BF's Samsung Note 3!  I am so in love with this product.  I am not regretting my purchase at all.  I also use this with Straight Talk.  I had a bit of an issue sending and receiving picture texts, but finally got the correct APN.

HasHad it for about a week. But had to return it because of the annoying case/ cover. Otherwise it was a good phone. I am not saying it was in the  class of Samsung.

Great phone! Inexpensive and easy to use. The only negative is sellers twice sent me 8gb phones instead of 16gb as specified in specs. Must have been trying to get rid of old inventory.  Would not hesitate to recommended this phone.

Really like the no contract. The only downside is the OS is not current and doesn't have the bells and whistles of its competitors. But for half the price of the competition, I'm not really going to complain.

I figured out how to receive picture messages on the blu life one using straight talk services.Go to your mobile networks in your settingsSelect the menu button on the phoneSelect new apnName- Straight TalkAPN- att.mvnoAPN type- default,mms,suplProxy- proxy.mvno.tracfone.comPort- 80Username- not setPassword- not setServer- not setMMSC- [...]MMS proxy- 66.209.11.33MMS port- 80MCC- 310MNC- 410Authentication type- not setAPN protocol- IPv4APN roaming protocol- IPv4APN enable/disable- APN enableBearer- UnspecifiedThen click the menu button again on the phone and select saveNext select straight talk apn you just created then restart the phoneSend yourself a picture message or to someone else and also make sure i-net worksThat the procedure.

I love the phone it is the right size, but the battery and WiFi is the worst ever. My battery is no good.

Purchased this several months ago. I love the quality and display of this phone, but the battery life suck and can't get the lastest android os (kitkat). Other than that its a pretty decent phone with some high end specs.

I have been using this phone for over a month and I love it! Why pay over $600 for a Samsung Galaxy S4??? THIS IS VERY NICE PHONE! I  really don't have anything bad to say about it. Highly Recommended!!  Battery life is great.... go's all day without a problem. I would say it is the best Android phone I have ever had.

Great phone. Love its features & functionality. However, I have a Lycamobile sim card and I can't figure out where to manually input the APN settings to get internet/data coverage via the carrier.  The phone does not capture the APN settings for Lycamobile automatically. Can you please guide me.

I have been using this phone for nearly a month now and have no complaints. Having upgraded from a Blu Vivo 4.3 the first thing I noticed was the size and the quality of the screen.  When outdoors with this phone I can read it with my sunglasses on. This makes it worth the money in my book. The dual sim functionality is awesome as I am using it with Optus in Australia and 2degrees in New Zealand. both roam internationally fine on AT&T; in the USA. The supplied earbuds I gave away as I much prefer using Marshall Minors. Look them up you will too. The 13MP camera is fantastic but took a little learning and tinkering, but then again what doesn't? The phone comes with 16GB on board memory which you can expand to 32GB via microSD.. I suggest you do this.I do agree with other comments that Blu should supply a second battery and also a silicone case of some kind. but it is a new(ish) phone so I expect they will be available soon.This phone is a great device and I recommend it highly. Primarily for value for money.

0 problems, got more than i expected for the price.  super happy with it. would def. recommended to others who want a very complete phone with most features found in expensive phones but at a reasonable price

Awesome phone, I haven't figured every out about it yet but every day I learn something new.

Great phone.  Using on Att no contract plan. Bought 2 phones. Both work well.  4 and not 5 stars given because a).  Difficult to find a case other than the flimsy cheap plastic ones. b). Speakers are not great and does not sound loud.  Not a good phone if you like to use the speaker while talking or for music or in meetings.  c).  Settings are limited for allowing notifications of emails and SMS and apps.I plan to continue buying blu products.  Great alternative phone.

Amazing mobile for the price and so fast in all apps. =) works fine in Venezuela movistar.

I would have liked to see the 4g option. Otherwise,  it's on awesome phone, absolutely beautiful device, and is priced right. Keep up the great work BLU. Way to go on shaking up the competition!Reporting from, Corbett Lantis, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

I highly recommend this phone to anyone that want a phone that just works. No need to spend $700 on an unlocked premium phone. I use the 2 SIM cards. One is a prepay T-Mobile voice card that cost me $15.00 a year and the other is a T-Mobile unlimited data/text plan that cost $30.00 a month. I use a VOIP program to make calls and because T-Mobile works in the EU I can make calls all over the world.

I bought this phone, first Android, on March 17, 2014.  I am not real happy with this phone and I am comparing it to my Blackberry Curve, my first Android.  Too big, too heavy, all phone calls reverberate when speaking, other than this it's a good phone. When I was looking at Androids I was paying attention to - rooting, size of battery, volume, ease of use, internal and external RAM.  It met all the requirements quite nicely, just a little too big for me and a little too heavy.  I think I would have been much happier with the size and weight of the BLU MUSIC although not sure how that did on battery size?

i have to tell you that this phone is the best investment it is loaded with feature and I am extremely happy

I have had this phone for two weeks now and it is perfect! the 13mp camera is amazing and the 5mp front camera y very nice to! it is pretty fast, it has everything i wanted. I'm from Venezuela and so far it works fine! the only detail is that the sound speaker its a little low for my taste. But overall is an amazing smartphone and its price is even better! I love it so much!!

I have had this phone now for a month and like some others had some worries if it was going to be a good phone or not. This phone is really a good cell phone. I started out trying to use it with Wal-Mart family plan. It would drop almost every phone call and I thought I had made a $250 mistake. They are using the T-Mobile towers and I must not have one anywhere close to where I live. So I thought I would try one other thing and try Straight Talk out and see if the cell phone would work with them.Easy to set up and I knew they used Verizon towers. I used the AT&T; sim card that came in the packet. After getting the APN set up this phone worked like a charm. Its clear screen and fast moving made it nice to use. Calls are clear and sound is loud enough that it makes music sound darn good even without ear buds. I did install a sound booster to make sure sounds are loud enough for this old guy to hear.The only thing that has me bothered is the battery. I am not use to charging phone during the day. With heavy use be prepared to charge the cell phone during the day. My old phone I would charge overnight and it was good to go all day and most of the night. I have installed a battery saver and an app killer which has helped out a lot. Before I go to bed the cell phone is down to about 35% left on the battery.With all this said I am giving it 5 stars due to it has performed very well. The camera is great and the pictures are super clear. I put a 32 GB SD card in and loaded about 100 songs on it and it has made a good MP2 player as well. I put the setting below for the Straight Talk APN settings. Some people say they can&#8217;t receive pictures with text or send them. If you set the &#8220;APN Type&#8221; the same way with the AT&T; sim card you will not have a problem.Blu Life One is a great cell phone.Name: Straight TalkAPN: tfdataMMSC:[...]MMS Proxy: mms3.tracfone.comMMS Port: 80APN Type: default,supl,mms,hipri,tfdata

This is a fabulous phone, especially for the price. It's alot like the Samsung Galaxy but with a better camera. It's affordable, i's a good, customizable phone and I recommend it to everyone.

For the price the phone is great! Looks good, good size, takes good pictures, easy to use. Very similar to a samsung device.

So I've had this phone for a few weeks now and so far it's great. I like that it came with both a case and screen cover, as well as headphones and a charger. The setup went smooth and everything works the way it's supposed to. The screen is crisp and clear, the colors are incredible. Battery life is very good for what I use the phone for. I stream music for about an hour a day, check email, make a few calls and send a few texts, nothing too serious and still have 80% life at the end of the day. The virtual keyboard works very well even with my large fingers. That's been a problem with other phones in the past. The phone moves through apps very quickly. The only ding I have so far is that the external speaker isn't as loud as I would like, but that's it. This phone stacks up quite well against what's out there right now yet it's less than half the price. Unless you're the type of phone junkie that demands the latest greatest device, the Life One should more than fill the bill. Oh, and the camera on this is incredible.

This review is not intended to explain in depth all of the features and specs. There are many other reviews that covered that extensively.This review is intended to address some concerns mentioned by other reviews if you are on the fence about purchasing this phone (I was on that situation and had some doubts after reading many reviews). But I bought the Blu Life One (Gray) anyway and here is the outcome:First, a list of possible show stoppers that I saw in other reviews together with my personal experience related to those problems/issues:1. Very weak Wi-Fi antenna: if this issue, which was mentioned on several reviews, had been accurate, it would have been a deal breaker for me as I am usually at home or in the office, with a 45-minutes commute in between the two. So I use Wi-Fi most of the day. The Wi-Fi antenna is actually pretty decent. I can be 20-30 feet away from the wireless router with a wall in between us and still get a pretty good signal (good enough for video streaming for example - definitely very good for web-browsing). I compared the Wi-Fi reception to a Samsung Galaxy SII (my previous phone) and I found them to be very similar actually (the Samsung Galaxy is a flagship phone and it costs $600 when it firsts comes out). The only difference that I noticed is in the number of bars that show the signal strength on the upper right corner of the screen (notifications bar). Sometimes the Galaxy would show three bars while the Blu Life One would show only two bars, etc. However, the actual speed/quality of video I used for testing purposes was similar with no lagging. I tested the same HD video clip from YouTube on both phones to compare and had similar results. Wi-Fi is a pretty tricky issue because it depends on what router you have, what channel you set it to broadcast, how many other routers are in the area (I live in a New York City apartment so usually there are 12-15 other wireless routers in range which is the reason why I consider 30 feet away to be "normal signal strength")2. Screen auto-dims: I don't have that issue although I have seen it in some of the YouTube reviews when the phone first came out. I know that Blu customizes the Jelly Bean version of Android and they either corrected this problem with later builds or some models never had that problem. I own the Gray version with Custom build BLU_L120_V08_GENERICO3 which is dated 2014-01-11. Perhaps previous versions of the customized Android OS were different. There is a TIMEOUT shortcut in the "pull-down" Settings (when you pull down the notification bar and click on the Settings icon) and three different lengths can be set for time-outs (which is when the screen goes to sleep). There is also a customization option under Settings/Display/Sleep that allows for 15 Seconds, 30 Seconds and 1-2-5-10-30 minutes. The second option (the one where you select the length of time) overrides the TIMEOUT shortcut. Meaning that even if you set TIMEOUT to long, if you set 15 seconds in Settings/Display/Sleep the phone goes to sleep after 15 seconds. But this is exactly how Android is designed to work and no different than other Android devices I own or had in the past (Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, Acer Iconia, Samsung Galaxy phones, LG phones, etc.)3. Buttons under the screen are hard to see in the White version of the Blu Life One: it's true. The problem is that Blu designed the Menu, Back and Option buttons (cut-outs more than buttons since they are not physical buttons but touch-responsive) simply too thin for the back-light to be noticeable enough. I compared those buttons with the counterparts from the Samsung Galaxy SII and the icons/cut outs that represent each one of those three functions are much wider/bigger, making the back-light much more visible. This is by the way the reason why I decided on the gray color phone after watching a video review of the white version on YouTube where you couldn't see the buttons at all. On the gray version, you can minimally see the buttons but on the white version you can't because the back-light is white also so the combination of size and color of the back-light makes it impossible to see. This was an oversight from the designers but once your fingers "learn" where the buttons are located, you can press them without looking at them as it is not too hard to memorize their location. If you absolutely need to see the buttons every time, then I recommend the gray version.4. It doesn't come with KitKat flavor of Android (the latest version): this is true as of 6/10/2014; there is no update to the Android version yet. However, it is very likely that Blu will have an update in the future. But even if that doesn't happen, this is still a great phone and Jelly Bean works really well in general and with this particular phone (I have Jelly Bean in 3-4 different devices and I have no complains about it). In fact, I heard complains about KitKat like not being able to move App data to the memory card, something that it is very useful when you have many Apps and the 1GB of RAM memory starts getting full...Other observations:1. Warranty: the phone doesn't come with a warranty sheet/policy or even a mention of it in the instruction manual, which is pretty minimal too (no warranty explanation inside the box at all). At first I thought there is no warranty whatsoever and if anything happens to the phone you are on your own. I contacted Blu and they sent me a PDF via email that explains the warranty: 1 year parts - 6 months battery - 6 months accessories. Of course nothing is covered if you damage it due to improper use but that's standard with any phone manufacturer.2. Customer Service: it's pretty bad. They take 2-3 days to answer a question via email and they usually half answer it. For example, I asked them about the warranty and how much would it cost to repair a broken/damaged screen (which is never covered by any manufacturer warranty) in the same email. They responded about the policy but forgot to attach the actual document (even though they said: "please find attached" and they didn't say anything about the screen repair. So I emailed them a few more times and finally they sent the attachment and told me that it costs $145 to repair the screen for the white version. It is my guess that the reps are not there full time. They use names like A.C. and R.C. and either they are business people or engineers responding whenever they can, or they are not properly trained customer service reps. Their written English is perfect so this is no overseas operation (they are probably in Miami where the company is based). The not so great customer service is somewhat expected of a company the size of Blu - basically they are a start-up in the mobile industry (they don't have the budget of a Samsung/HTC/Motorola, etc. for customer service, marketing, QA Testing and other operations). But customer service does exist and if you ever need to send your phone in for a repair it will happen (although it may take weeks until you see your phone back)Things I liked about this phone (there is a lot to like...):1. Screen: the phone has a very sharp 5 inches screen. Forget what the resolution nerds and marketing teams going after your hard earned money tell you. 300dpi is as detailed a resolution as the human eye is trained to see on a 5 inches screen. This phone has 296dpi (approx.) so it is right there. Today some phones are made with screen resolutions that are actually higher than 50 inches TVs were two years ago (on a 5 inches screen).  That is to make you think that it is better than older models. But there is a point where you just can't see the difference. And Blu Life One is right there at the edge of where you can't tell the difference anymore. All I can tell you is that when I watched Planet Earth on HD from YouTube to test video image quality, what I saw is as good as it gets.2. Cameras: both of them are really good. The front camera at 5 Megapixels is superb. Quality of Skype calls and even the occasional "selfie" pictures are simply outstanding (much better than my work iPhone 5 is on Skype or Facetime for example). I use the back camera (13 Megapixels) to photograph receipts for tax purposes with an App called Expense Manager and the receipts look as good as in real life (very detailed). Landscapes look very sharp too.3. Antennas: Wi-Fi, GPS, and HDSP+ on T-Mobile all work fine and fast (fast Wi-Fi, fast Mobile Data, GPS gets your location fast). Don't even mind not having 4G LTD. It's plenty fast (similar to Wi-Fi "N" at home)4.  Dual SIM: nice if you travel to other countries for work/vacation and want to use a local service.5. Construction: Blu Life One looks and feels very solid and stylish with no flaws other than the buttons that are hard to see in the white version (volume button, power button, headphone jack, USB port all are where they should be and they work very well). The case that it comes with is very nice too and not bulky at all. It doesn't provide great protection so if you are likely to drop your phone (I know I am) I would suggest to get an armor or hybrid case, or at least a plastic/silicone case (anything will be more protective than the case that it comes with, but it will add more bulk too and perhaps they will be less stylish).6. The battery is removable and the ROM memory is expandable. You can buy replacement batteries here on Amazon for about $15. This is very nice. I can't tell you how many times a phone's battery became much weaker after one year of use and I had no means to replace it (I am looking at you iPhone). Also, if the 16GB memory that are built into the Blu Life One aren't enough, you can buy a MicroSD card with another 16-32GB and put your entire music collection on your phone. Those are features that are normally not part of budget phones but only included in flagship phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S family. I was very surprised that even middle range phones like the Moto X doesn't have removable battery or expandable memory. Job well done Blu for adding those two.A couple of things I disliked (or at least I didn't understand the thinking of the peeps at Blu):1. Customized version of Android. Why? Why? Why? Here the Blu folks had a great opportunity to deploy a plain Vanilla OS (original Android version without modifications) and join the ranks of Nexus phones or the Moto G-E-X phones but did not take that chance. The modifications aren't many but none of them are necessary (the camera has a different user interface for example but the stock Android interface is just fine. Under "Display" they have an option for "Theme" which allows you to choose between Default (blue), Mint, Mocha and Raspberry. That changes the colors of all the buttons, navigation, etc. but there is no need to include a Theme option outside of the customization options that are native to Android. However, in the Blu customized version of Android they omitted a few very useful features. For example, HTC and Samsung phones with Jelly Bean 4.1 and older have an option to output audio via the micro USB port (dock mode). I use that in my car because with one cable you can both charge the phone and play music via the Aux input (provided that you have the right cable). This is better than using Bluetooth for example because all you have to do is plug in the phone and it automatically goes into "Dock" mode and sends the music to the car stereo from Pandora or other Apps/music players. This is similar to how the iPhone works when docked. So while the alterations by Blu weren't many, it is annoying that they added useless things like color options for the menus while they subtracted useful operational features. I always resented carriers like Verizon who customizes the OS to be able to sell you more things and block you from using third party services, etc. So here you have a company (Blu) that builds only unlocked cell phones but they decided to monkey with the OS without a real need to do so. That's almost tragic, as they had an opportunity to be the kings of unlocked, untouched, un-customized devices which would have put them in a very unique position compared to the other phones which unfortunately need to be customized for each carrier (because the carriers require that from each device manufacturer). If Blu deplays KitKat at some point and they don't remove useful Android features, I'll update this review.2. Headphones come included, which is very nice. However, I can't use iPhone's original headphones with the Blu Life One. I have no idea why. The jacks look very similar in size (with three white lines on the metal prong) but for some reason when I plug in the headphones that came with Blu Life One, there is a little headphone icon that appears on the notification bar and phone calls/Skype calls go through the headphones. However, when I plug in the iPhone's headphones nothing happens and the calls go to the Phone's speakers. I haven't experimented with other headphones but if the Blu Life One only works with the included Blu headphones, that's an issue (headphones always break sooner or later and I don't believe Blu sells them separately). I'll update the review if I find that the Life One actually works with any other third party headphones different from the iPhone's.3. As mentioned above, Customer Service at Blu is an after-thought. I imagine Blu being a company with some very smart/geeky engineers, some of whom seem to speak Spanish (they name their own software modifications: "GENERICO") who started the company and still run it (if you look at the Life One reviews on YouTube posted by Blu Products, you'll see what I am talking about. I've seen this cheese take on The Matrix where they talk about the Red Box versus the "Blu box" - come on, seriously? You would give Steve Jobs and his marketing team at Apple a heart attack if they ever saw that. These Blu folks probably really get excited about Specs (how fast the processor is, how many Gigs of memory, who has the largest screen... "9 inch phone dude - totally") but they probably don't really put much attention to user experience (hence the buttons you can't see in the white phone), customer service (it's like going to the dentist - medium to very painful) or getting deals in place with third party accessory makers (top dogs like Otterbox don't even make cases for Blu phones...the iPhone headphones don't work with Blue phones but work with just about any other phone, and so on and so forth)Conclusion:When you think that the Blu Life One costs only $215 (at the time of this review) which is not much more than it costs to repair/replace a Smartphone screen (usually around $150-$170), it is easy to overcome some of the very minor annoyances (they are really very minor and I have never seen a phone that was actually perfect, they all have a couple of annoyances - even the $600-$800 Samsung Galaxies and iPhones do). If you actually compare it with other phones in the $200-$250 range (thinking about you Moto G) it is easy to determine that the Blu Life One is the clear winner in all aspects: size, design, functionality, speed. In fact, the Life One puts a good fight against Android heavy-weights like the Samsung Galaxy S4-S5 or the HTC One - M7-M8 at basically 1/3 of those flagship phone's price, which is pretty darn good. Since phones don't last more than 1-2 years anyway because they become obsolete, their screen breaks when you drop them or they slow down due to software issues, I don't see any reason to spend $600-$800 on a phone when you can get the Blu Life One for $215. It's simply the best your money can buy at this price point in this moment of time. Personally, I find it very hard to justify spending $600-$800 because in all honesty, the Moto X, the Samsung Galaxy S5 or the iPhone 5S are not that much better anyway. They are some folks that probably have some very particular needs like NFC - Near Field Communication, or 2GB of RAM, or Application developers who want to experiment with Flagship phones that are very popular. They may want to spend $600-$800 on a phone. Good for them. For the rest of us mortals, the Blu Life One does the job and it does it fast, in style and for a fraction of the cost. For that achievement, Blu deserves all the credit and then some.If after reading this review, you have any questions about the Blu Life One, please let me know and I'll try to respond (if I know the answer) when I have a chance. Thank you!

WHY BLU PRODUCTS ???? Let me tell you the real situation about the blu phones. The decent quality, 2 sim cards, good prices, good specs for a budget phone and TERRIBLE SUPPORT OR NO SUPPORT AT ALL. THINK twice before buy anything from BLU PRODUCTS COMPANY.Short story - you bought the BLU phone and its working with no issues - you very LUCKY !! start playing lottery $) and be happy BLU PRODUCTS owner.Long story - you bought the BLU phone and you have some issues (DOA, headphone jack broken, black pixels on the screen, short battery life, Android is always low on memory, ECHO on microphone .. screen clicking by itself ...etc ) - welcome to HELL !!If you still have refund or replacement period = you lucky again. Otherwise - YOU JUST WAISTED 200$-300$ from your wallet. If you want to find the truth $) be my guest = read the whole story = IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME AND PAIN !!!First off I had 4 Smartphone's. (3 had issues)2012 1st Blu Studio 5.3 - black dots, bad design of case - the screen was visible detached from system board. = sent for replacement.2012 2nd Blu Studio 5.3 - first half year great phone for its money. (270$) great battery life - 4-5 days with 5.3 screen = very happy. until the headphone jack stopped working normally - some hiss sound with tapping when you plug the headphones. no more movies or private conversations on the go ... Tried to fix it... went to couple stores for repair - the verdict unfixable ... Give it away to my neighbors to use it as GPS on his car.Tried to contact BLU Products for warranty repair - welcome to some BLU marry-go-round - "please contact distributor" and distributor replays ... since its out of 30 days from the day of purchase - "please contact BLU products" I did wrote around 30 yes its 30 !!!!! emails ... trying to resolve this issue ... still no help.Hmm ... I am still trying to find the truth $) and some service . I did find the email of CEO of BLU Products ... and sent to him all my correspondence with the supervisors from BLU and Vendor stamped by dates ... in one huge email .... just to be relieved of this whole nonsense and terrible customer support.2013 3rd BLU STUDIO 2 - To be honest I was surprised when I got answer from him directly . Very delicate and nicely written letter with apology and offer to get new model of BLU STUDIO 5.3 Smartphone !!! free of charge. OMG all this emails .. looking for help finally paid off... HAPPY END ???? NO WAY only half story ...When I got new Smartphone BLU Studio 5.3 II. It worked nicely for couple weeks than ... its start failing APART.Here are list of issues with BLU smarphone1) Clicking by itself ... and the screen is not responsive a lot of times (even when I did factory reset and as test did capture couple pictures ... it happened again and again)enjoy the terrible unknown feature by BLU products smartphone .... clicking by itself randomly ... can happen 1 time in a week or 5 times during the DAY !!![...][...][...]2) Low RAM ... Even with couple applications since its only 512 mb of ram its freezing and shutting down apps . A lot of freezing with GPS on and map from Google with data connection on and Bluetooth on. Especially when trying to play music on background ... its start freezing and shutting down applications by itself.3) Very low battery life ... the original BLU were holding up to 4-5 days of active use ... this one ... less than a DAY. (I did charging now 2 times a day)4)Echo - a lot of complains from my coworkers and friends .So I did start warranty service on this "gift" from CEO of BLU PRODUCTS. I was out of states for work... So it took me a several weeks to send for repair/ replacement.I was assured multiply times that if issues (the main one - clicking on the screen by itself) will be confirmed - they will replace it with new model.But in real life ...another 20 emails ... no real help ... only promises to resolve the issue and make me happy. they tried to charge me 80$ for replacing wet ?? system board .. and finally sent back pretty much same unit with replaced screen, system board and same defective battery ... nice job....and for defective battery I was given advice - "to buy the new one " since  6 hours battery life (even when not using) is basically good battery life according to BLU customer support.2013 4th BLU STUDIO 2 - So for now I did give it to friend as present. with explanation - no obligation from me.... and if something will happen to this phone ??? I don't care and don`t do anything Real to help with this wonderful Smartphone. Lesson learned from BLU PRODUCTS support. $) Good luck.

This is the best phone ever! It is very fast, the phone has a beautiful display and the it is the perfect size. With BLU I slipped in my Net 10 sim card and within minutes my phone was working. This is a purchase you will not regret.2/5/2014  This phone continues to amaze me!  It is lightening fast especially wifi.  I have not had one minutes trouble with it and I get lots of compliments.  Yes, I do wish I could find a case that fits but I bought a wrist wallet and it fits perfectly.  I am just very careful not to drop it.

Great Phone !!! Very Satisfied. We recommed this phone. Works better than Iphone for a cheap price. Battery is great

I spent hours researching phones and finally decided to get the BLU Life One L120. I have been using it for about a month and overall I am very pleased with the phone. I won't bore you with repeating all the good things about the phone but rather focus on the little issues that I find could be better.1. Weak WiFi - My office desk is about 20 feet from the WiFi router, separated by a couple of drywalls. At most times I get 2-3 bars on the phone and using apps like 'WiFi Analyzer' I see that the signal strengths I get are around -65dBm. I noticed the low bars at home as well and compared the results with an iPhone (no apps to give specific signal strength) and a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Using the same app with the phones sitting right next to each other the difference is about 15-20 dBm in favor of the Samsung. This area could use some work on BLU's part. At times I will lose total WiFi connectivity if I step away too far (even at home).2. Touchy buttons - The backlit menu, home and back keys sometimes don't behave. At times when I touch them, they won't do a thing and at other times it will register a single touch as multiple touches.3. Processor - At times I like to play a very processor and memory intensive racing game called &#34;Real Racing 3&#34;. Even though this app is installed on the internal storage the load times are horrendous and lag is clearly visible. This game normally has great graphics but this phone will not render them properly (does a B+ job).Other than the main issues listed above I have nothing but praise for this device. Camera, Dual Sim, Screen size all are great features to have especially at the phenomenal price. And since these issues don't affect my daily use of the phone as much, I am giving it 4 stars.

It's tough buying a phone when you're a college student on a budget but BLU makes a lovely amount of affordable yet high quality phones that make it easy for a college student on a budget. I had my reservations buying from BLU because it's not the most well known smartphone brand out there and I've been using Samsung's Galaxy phones for a good few years. I've been using the BLU Life One for two months now and everything about it has been great, greater than I expected. The screen is great with it's large size and vibrant display. There was no problem with making phone calls, sending text messages, or using the internet because all I had to do was pop in my sim card (I use T-mobile) and the phone was ready to be used. It handles graphic heavy games rather well, I don't experience lag and I've yet to have to force-close an application for that matter. Even better is that it doesn't come loaded with a bunch of bloatware, so I didn't have to spend time deleting useless applications. It's a phone that feels good in my hands and I think it's the perfect size smartphone with a really good camera. When time comes to buy a new phone, I think I'll probably buy another BLU phone.

Nice phone!

I love this phone so far it has done everything I need in a phone.. Camera could be a lil better but its do able just put the scene in night portrait mode and its fine. I would recommend it for a gud phone and reasonable price for this device

I live in Brazil, where smartphones are frequently stolen, so didn't want to invest in an expensive phone, but did want one with a large screen and good camera. This one is of the size of a Samsung Galaxy, and has a 12 mega pixel camera, which I think is much better than that of my wife's iphone.The price is about 1/2-2/3 of a high end smartphone like a Galaxy or Iphone. So, it didnt take me long to convince myself that this phone was a better option for the way I tend to use smartphone (emails, social media, pictures, maps, phone, whatsapp and occasionally netflix)To be honest I dont care too much about the other specs like the processor, screen definition, etc. So cannot comment on these elements.ADDITION:I have had this phone now for about 2 months. One problem I have encountered so far is that static electricity seems to impact it's performance. I listen to audible books when I walk to work, and when I keep the phone, while listening, in my trouser pockets, the sound breaks off very frequently. Initially I thought the problem was with the headphones or the part where you insert them into the phone. Hence changed the headphones but kept having the same problem. Eventually I discovered one way to avoid that problem, which as to carry the phone somewhere where it doesn't get exposed to friction with fabrics (like inside trouser pockets). That little trick seems to solve the issue, but it's far from ideal.

Phone is awesome; but charger was defective. Can't use phone if u have no charger. This phone is great though .

Great phone I couldn't buy it on amazon cause when i wanted it they were out of stock. But i got one none the less. I have it on Straight Talk At&t and am now getting the best coverage I've ever had with any phone I've ever owned,  I've heard bad stories about there customer support but i'm sure in due time they will improve on that. Anyway the phone is solid preforms well and keeps a great battery life. With any brand new battery powered device always do a full drain of the battery and complete recharge when you buy it to ensure good battery life, but i have seen that my phone lasts about a day and a half on one full charge.

Excelente equipo. Muy r&aacute;pido y liviano.
