as stated in the description is what i received without hassle cannot complain at all, bought it for my girlfriend and she's loving it

I ordered white & received a black one. Phone works fine but battery does not stay charged as long as it should. Would have liked to receive what I ordered.

I ordered a white iPhone 4 and long story short, if didn't work and I had to send it back and they sent me a black one. Sooo it wasn't what I expected and the process was too long. But I'm happy with the phone I have now.

there is several things wrong with the phone and on top of it it was way over priced so not worth it.!!!!!!

EXACTLY what I wanted.!!! I love it, it came with everything I needed. I couldn't ask for anything more:). .

I am very an happy ,angry, the phone doesn't make calls , the signal is very bad so I take to apple gay to fix , and the phone is missing a lot of parts there's nothing they can do I waste my money

It actually works fine. Everything was acting right as I suspected. There were no malfunctions and everything worked like normal.

The product ordered was exactly what was advertised. Came when promised and in condition as spoke of . I am very pleased with my purchase.

The phone was just as the man described it appearance but he told me it was jail broken and it wasn't so I wasn't to happy about that.

When I decided to choosed the store to buy iphone4, and related to the seller. He is a good man. I received the first mobile phone, found it has some problems, and returned and changed the other one. Now, I have used for almost a year, although it has some trouble, I think, is also acceptable.

Phone works with the exception of the home button giving problems but overall works fine got this as a gift from someone

This phone has terrible reception!  Alot of folks dont remember that when they first issued this phone there were complaints about holding placement of the antenna, your hand would block reception. Let me tell you that no matter how I held this phone it still got bad reception. Example: there is a movie theater where I could get no bars on my phone at all. Yesterday when I went in with my new Iphone 5s, I had 3bars LTE !! It shows you what a wretched piece of crap the Iphone 4 was. I was trapped in a contract for 2 years with this phone, good riddance!

It is good! Thank you! I have a new phone for me. I like it very much. I will be activated it. Huh, huh!

just as described love it easy to set up just put my sim card in and presto it worked perfect

Extremely happy with my IPhone. Have had no problems. I ordered a white phone but got a black one. But can live with that

This phone is a pretty good deal for the money that it cost -- my niece has noticed a couple of odd quirks with it, but nothing that would have prevented her from buying the phone.  We have AT&T and were able to buy this phone, bring it to the store, get a free Sim card and then have it activated same-day -- only costs $15/month for this line b/c it's a phone that's not in contract even though it's an iPhone.  Not bad.

From i received it had no issues.It looked as good a s new and works well.thanks for this product.

i asked for unlocked iPhone 16gb and i got 8gb, that's fraud.i can't use the phone, just thereand i paid for what i cant use

Great device!  Exactly what we wanted. Unlocked and works great. In perfect condition.  Came in 2 days. My daughter is very satisfied. We r tmobil customers.

I want to say for the price I paid for this phone was well worth it. It was in way better condition than I expected it to be. it should have been 10/10. I thank the sell first of all for there feedback on my questions I had about the product n their honesty in the information they provide. I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again in the near future. 2nd the product was nicely package preventing any damage during shipping thank u for letting me know my money was well spent on your company. thank u.

Battery dead only in few days since  I received it. I had to return.It need to be checked before sending out .

So I was waiting for what seemed like an eternally long time to get the white iPhone 4 after the black one came out because apple couldn't figure out how to properly place the ambient light sensor, but that aside, I love this phone. Apple continues to be the leading manufacturer in consumer electronics, especially the phone industry. This phone shipped with iOS 4.0, and Apple's still taking it with them to iOS 7, and that's awesome. With a 5 MegaPixel camera sensor, and an autofocus lens with flash, and 720p Video @ 24 fps, Photo quality is beautiful. Yes, it does lag a little bit when I have a lot of background apps running, and when they're gone, the Phone feels as good as new even with all the extraneous apps I've packed into it. Every time I turn it on I smile to myself at how beautiful this thing is, and how nice it feels in your hand. Yes, from the outside it might look like it might be uncomfortable to hold seeing it has not smooth or curved edges, but actually the stainless steel antenna/band provides both a tapered design element, and a grip for both large and small hands. The glass on this phone surpasses the entire device except for the little strip of steel running all the way around, and that adds a sort of ambience to it when you look at it. Also, the battery life is amazing. I easily use this for up to 24 hours while just calling, texting, checking my feeds, and watching the occasional YouTube video. This phone is a great buy, and is just another Apple miracle.

I recently got my iphone 4 on wednesday 01/08/14. I beleive there is something wrong with the screen because there are horizontal lines that are goun across my screen and it looks as though my phones screen is vibrating. I don't know if this a default or if i should try to reset to factory settings again.

excelente el vendedor el producto llego bien a mi casa en venezuelalo recomiendo el vendedorproducto es bien y excelente estoy muy contento con el iphone 4

It is a very good phone it is smooth ghn yhbvg yhbvg hj Vbjk hulk ghn yhbvg the ghn fbb

I bought it used and it is in good condition. It was a lot cheaper than a brand new one.

Iphone was in great condition as promised. I could not find anything wrong. Thank you for making my Christmas shopping that much easier! I would definitely buy from again.

I like the phone the only small problem was the screen kept blacken out. Other then that I loved the phone!

Not to happy with the iPhone I purchased for my daughter. The front camera doesn't work and also it's hard to connect to our wifi. I don't understand why it will not connect to the wifi when all the rest of our iPhones do anywhere we go. The one I bought you have to sit right next to the wifi signal and then it will work.

I purchased the the Iphone for my daughter's birthday and it came almost a month later.  When it arrived we found that it was locked and possibly stolen.  I sent it back right away and asked for a second phone, only to find it too was locked, rendering it useless. I again promptly returned the second phone.  I was told that I will receive a refund once the phone was inspected.  I patiently waited, requesting a status update once a week.  Eventually, they stopped responding.  I filed a claim, submitting my tracking # and everything only to be denied.  I called Amazon to dispute it further only to be told that I didn't request a signature with delivery and there's no way to prove that they received it.  That's fine. I have spent a good bit of money with Amazon through the years but I am done.  I feel that I had been had and now I'm out over $240 for the phone.

Excuse me, i'm new using this service and i don't know if it's here were i should ask this.Anyway, i wanted to ask you what version of software IOS does it have this iphone 4.I'm for a few days in USA, so i would apreciate if you could answer me as soon as posibleThanks

Loved the iphone. Great buy. Great price for a greater item then the price. Totally awesome. iPhone 4 AT&T 16gb

We all want  iphones now!  We have TMobile so had to unlock the phone but it works great and has many free apps to use.  Easy to use.

I want buy this cell phone, but I have two questions. Is it unlocked  or it works only with ATT? what's the return policy on it?

D Marketing is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with they sold me a used phone that was suppose to be new! Then I went to AT&T to have it activated and they told me the phone was reported stolen or lost!!! This was suppose to be a Christmas gift!!! when I sent the phone back they then tried to say they didn't receive it when usps had them sign for the delivery I would give them NO STARS if I could but I can't.

Pros:FastEasy to useTons of AppsBattery is amazing (2 days without charging and moderate use)Cameras work very wellFlash is brightStylishiOS 5 brings some new functionality (notification center, iMessage, etc)Cons:No 4GNot super customizable (can be fixed somewhat with jailbreak)I'd highly recommend it.

This product was in a fair to good condition, i can never be consider as a like new item, and probably i should have read better the description, but it should be clearer since it is very deceiving how it is writing!!! in conclusion. Not happy.

Hello, I would like to know if this iPhone is unlocked to Brazil area. I'm interested of buying some units.

I bought this phone for my daughter. She is very pleased with it, she said that everything works great. Loves that she can elimate the need for her ipod with the phone, and the camera works great.

i wanna know if this iphone can be unlocked with the gevey sim 'couse im from ecuador and i wanna buy this phone, but i'll like to be sure about its functionality

I would not purchase another iphone - phone is a great tool. however the reception is terrible, having a cover helps but still poor quality phone.

It seems a little slow at downloading and it has spells where the screen will go completely black when entering numbers I am not 100% happy with this product

I use my phone all the time! The shipping was fast and the product was as described in the description. Was in the original box and the phone itself was better looking than I expected. ( I was a little iffy about buying a phone online and not with a &#34;official&#34; carrier&#34;) But I was surprised and I will order from again)

This phone is great...works wonderful! Very happy with it. Great price for an awesome product...delivery was fast also! Arrived in box and with accessories! Charger just didn't work...but that's an easy cheap replacement!

Phone works good.but the seller didnt mension the problem with the power button. It's working good but it will break down any time. It dont click when I press it.

So i got this today (12/27/12)and it sucked.the top unlock button was slightly stuck on the top and was locked AND unactivated when i got it plus the original box smelled like old woman and nail polish remover, the only good part about this phone was that it was updated to IOS 6.1 and that's about it.i couldn't use it AT ALL because it needs to be unlocked sooo...IF ANYONE IS GOING TO BUY THIS PHONE, BE PREPAIRED TO HAVE TO UNLOCK IT AND ACTIVATE IT YOURSELF.I also bought the GPP CDMA/GSM phone unlock and it was absolutly NO GOOD.i'm very frustrated with this product and i have to get it factory unlocked to avoid all the BS. :/^ take this review into consideration. it may just be the buyer but BE AWARE and BE PREPAIRED for the worst :/

Works good, good price for needing it only 7 months until my upgrade.  Was in good shape and I'm satisfied

FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THIS ITEM IT DOES NOT SEEM NEW AND IT IS DIRTY!  I Brought ANOTHER PHONE FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY AND DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. I feel so upset about ordering this for my daughter birthday. The description stated that this was a new phone and not a referbished one.This companys is has done a lot of please wrong. I feel like they have sole from me. This phone was scraed damaged and used,

Good shipping, satisfied about condition and packaging. This is a good seller that I can trust and I'm pretty happy that the phone that was delivered is in stable condition, no scratches at all on the screen or back. Bumper was flimsy but I'll get something else. 5/5 phone though.

can this one be unlocked? or does it come unlocked for any carrier? I was wondering because some say they can't be unlocked and some say they can be

Bought the locked phone but it was very easy to unlock free of charge by at&t;(meaning it was not stolen:) )I sent it to my dad in Africa & it works very well.No trouble so far

It got here quickly.It's exactly as stated.Works wonderfully.And when I had some concerns they were friendly and helped clear things up quickly! Very nice!

I did buy a phone from them, it was broken and I paid for the repair. When they read my review and saw that I was an unhappy customer they where quick to fix the issue. They refunded me my money spent on repairs and shipping. So the reason I am now happy with my purchase.

I was expecting a unlocked phone but unfortunately came locked..and also the battery is so weak .. it runs almost half a day ...very poor and untrustworthy ..very disappointing :(

The Apple iPhone 4 is a reliable phone.  While it has been replaced by the 4s, the older version is still a good phone.

The phone itself is great, but however they didn't mention the turn off and on  button was very hard to use.you really have to push down on it to turn the phone off or on, but overall the phone is great! my teenage daughter is very impressed with it.......Thanks for a great deal!!

I returned it as it had not been completely refurbished.  The screws were missing out of the case and would fall apart in your hands.  Also, the buttons only partially worked.  That could have been a result of it not being put together properly.  Glad I did'nt wait for Christmas to give it to my Grandson.  I did receive full reimbursement of the product, but what a hassle.

I liked the phone, it was very good and the price was also good. I would recommend it to anyone. A nice phone.

I recommend this product!!!!was almost perfect. delivery was fast, incredible cell conditions. I am very happy with my purchase. very good price and it was almost new. Me encanto!

I have received it next day when I start order. The delivery is amazing fast and this new iPhone 4 is very good for use.

Yes my phone is everything I wanted it to be and more! I love it. I love having pictures of my grand babies on my  phone to share with others! Texting is new to me but I like that too. I wouldn't have bought any other phone, very satisfied!!!

My phone arrived in great condition and works like it's brand new. I love it! Richmond Wholesale, who I purchased the phone from, worked with me in any way they could to help me get some kinks worked out with my phone company and I can now use all of it's features. I am very pleased with the product and service I have received.

i like it, this was in perfect condition,. I recommend it to all people who wish to purchase one of this

It only worked for one day. It could not be fixed according to the Apple store . I will not purchase a phone item in the future. I not only paid for the broken one I had to purchase another phone .

the phone works great however for some reason it cannot be unlocked (which sucks) but i can all ways transfer my number and use at and t

I got my iphone 4 the day i was told it would come. Irs perfect and im always on it.i have all of my music on it. I would buy from him again. Also i was worried about my order coming and he told me when it got shipped and messaged me back.

I wasted $400 on this phone and ill never buy from here again. All of the buttons stop working after a month1/2 and then the phone just stop working completely. Don't waste your money like I did.

As with any Apple product, this was came in and is in perfect working condition. Looks brand-new and works perfectly.

:when I got the iPhone I was so excitedit came with everything they said it would:I had trouble getting the side open to put the sim in:yea about the Sim some of he iPhones take your original sim but this one you have to get a microsim for the phone $25 at radioshak:I called them to activate the sim AT&T; told me I also had to have a data plan $20 a month that's with all smart phones but I won't be using any data so idk I have wifi but I still have to have the data plan:overall his experience was alright the phone works so everything is good

instead of getting what I asked for they sent me a black I phone.For me it was inconceivable, sine the order included a picture and WHITE was written, I do not live in the us and was there for a limited time so I had to get back home with a black I phone!!!!!!

Im very fustrated at this moment.... i spent all this money on this phone and i cannot activate it without fixing it.... i spent $272 then another $20 for customer serivce for the phone to troubleshoot the problem i am very upset and will not buy another thing from Warehouse Deals Inc.

I am going on a trip and was hoping to have this new phone because my old one is broken. As a prime member, I was able to choose two day shipping. Nope. Still not here, and now I am going on a 2 week trip without a working phone. I am extremely angry with Amazon and this company. Had I known it would not get here, I would have made time to go to a store. Thanks a bunch Amazon.

I choose the 4 over the 4s because I didn't need siri. 4s is a little faster but I can live with it. Not to mention they have the exact same shell.

Because the phone is in perfect conditions and its fully functional and over all the phone is great conditions so far

the item that was sold to me was reported as a stolen item, and it was blocked from the network view by at&t.;I was black mailed by ther seller

We searched extensively online to find a good used iPhone 4 deal during the holiday season.  Found one on Amazon, purchased and had it shipped.  Item showed up days earlier than expected.  Device was configured and showed very little signs of wear and tear.  Great purchase for at an affordable great price in comparison to similar retailers.

would have been nice to have the usb cable it works fine not all beat looks good better so far then my old phone

The seller answered when it is needed, and made sure it was sent out when they said it was. it was exactly as described, and in good shape.

First iPhone4 and I could not be more pleased with the seller and the price thank you  this fits my life style and what I am looking for in a phone  I recommend  everyone

This should have said like new quality.  It was in great condition no flaws or cracks in the screen with very light to no wear and tear.

It is in a good condition, no scratch, ever though it is use! I like it. Oh by the way, it has a good base band too. He....he....you know what I mean.

My brother bought thsi phone online and it was supposed to be 16 GB and itbwas only 8 GB. Total blowoff... Phone is nice, and works great. But just that detail.

i  received my iphone earlier today & it looks like i just bought it at the apple store ! soo happy with my purchase definately will be purchasing from you guys again !

IS it a good idea to ""jail break"" this phone????? It's an overall good phone, I know.. But what about jail breaking it?? Can it mess up the phone?? Or no??

Very disappointed. Purchased a iPhone, when I received it, the phone was a piece of junk. I returned the phone for a refund, know she is saying I damaged the phone and will only give me a partial refund (what, one dollar?) Because she had to pay to get it repaired.I know it is not Amazon fault, that unfortunately there is dishonest people selling items through Amazon but I am extremely upset.

iPhone arrived as scheduled, works great except: the home button is pushed way in and is hard to push in general. Also when I tried to FaceTime, the other person couldn't hear me. It sucks I bought an iPhone and have to use my FaceTime on my old iPod.  I tried to leave a audio memo, and you could hear me clearly, not sure what's wrong with it but I'll be getting it checked soon.

beware ! if you need an iphone without sim tray then take ; otherwise , this is not at&t but verizon phone

I don't even have my phone yet and am upset.  I received a confirmation that my Iphone had shipped on the 18th.  13 days later I still don't have it.  When I finally reached the seller I got an email that said they were on vaca and my phone actually is shipping on the 31st.  At this point I am just hoping the phone is what I am expecting ( a brand new Iphone) but I am not hopeful.

Awesome with Verizon Wireless.  The 4S is not worth getting for one new minor feature voice control.  I have 8 Gb (6.2 gb) small but it is good enough.  The 3G is easy to burn through your data plan but that's with all 2010 up smart phones.  Battery runs out every two days if you use it regularly.  1/2 a day if your a text-addict ( like every body if the world).  But again every smart phone 2010 up runs through batteries.  Buy a case I suggest outer box not big for designs but most protective.  It has different colors thought.  Most apps work with 3G.  And Verizon Wireless has 5 to 4 bars in New England. Oh two differences 4s has better pictures not much different but if your into tacking a million pictures you want the 4s.  Ok reviews for this:  touch screen: *****'''''.CPU  speed:*****'''''. battery:***'''.  Camera:'''''*****. Verizon Wireless:***** '''''. Cost '''.***

so i live in Cleveland, Ohio and this item was shipped from Texas. it said in the description that it only came with the data cord and the actual iPhone(white 16gig att). well i got the 3-6 day shipping and got in the next day. i placed the order at 5:06 pm on may 24 and got here at 10:23 am may 25....i was so excited and amazed by how fast the shipping is. i opened up the package and to my surprise it was in the box...never used(said it was) with cable wall adapter headphones stickers and manuals.

Is this phone AT&T (as claimed in the title), or tied to Verizon (as being said by many customers here).. Pls Clarify, I'm interested in purchasing if its GSM based (AT&T)

I also something is wrong with the sound system sometimes it works sometimes it don't. Looks very good, like new.

does not work at allopen package , missing earphoneI bought it new but it seams its refurbished and in bad condition

Great condition, even came with an outer box case ! No scratches no debts perfect condition I am very satisfied &#128149;

I love my new Iphone!! It is high quality! Great sound, texting is easy, simple to use. Everything at my fingertips!!!!

Was in perfect condition, the only issue I had was that I had ordered a white one and got a black one but it was in such amazing condition I decided to just keep it, I'll probably get a case for it anyway.

The product was sent really dirty. The case that it came in was broken and the charger was really old. That is why I just had to return this product and would like my money back.

Just as expected, there were no surprises the phone had every feature advertized my daughter is happy ...then so am I

It works.  Its pretty.  Its fast.It isn't android, but not everyone gets in to customizing a phone.  I personally like the ability to pick up and use.  Some phones require lessons before you feel comfortable. Not the iphone.  My favorite feature is the facetime front facing camera.  Its easy to use.  Navigation pre installed. Plenty of free apps.The screen is a truly beautiful thing.  You have to see it to believe it.  If you are into gaming on your Iphone then you will appreciate the power behind this device.  Without getting technical I will say RageHD is the best looking game on any phone... period.  It rivals the graphics of some console games.  Overall the Iphone 4 is fun to use and I think you will enjoy it.  I'm not sure what the other reviewer has against the phones personally but this is my review.  Take it from a person that started with windows mobile and used android for years.  If you like apple you will love this.

Was looking forward to receiving this unlocked phone for use on an alternative GSM carrier.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  After several unsuccessful calls to AT&T attempting to unlock, I am returning this to Amazon.
