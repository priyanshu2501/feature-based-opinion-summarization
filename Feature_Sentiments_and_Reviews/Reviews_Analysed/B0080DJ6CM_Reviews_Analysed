Negative Reviews:

---'it is not able to read apps off of an sd card.' **** 'able'
---'i am amazed at the power of the galaxy s3, it is based on android, and android was based on linux, and linux based on unix!it is as flexible as a pc, you can just drag and drop any files to it, like a windows environment, and it works great, videos, music files, no need to use itunes like iphone.you can add almost any program or app to suit your needs like the windows environment, completely free from the google play, i spent more than $1000 for apps for my iphone, and i got the same apps free from play.the only negative side is there are fewer games for the kids, the are more games available for iphone.the processing speed is faster, load faster in flipborad.you also save in storage, because adding a 32 g. sd card is just about $30, instead of paying $200 more for a 64 g. iphone.' **** 'free'
