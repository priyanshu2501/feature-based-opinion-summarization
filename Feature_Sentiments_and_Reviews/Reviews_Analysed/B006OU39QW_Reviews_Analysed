__________('battery', 'life')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'battery life was always very good until the past few months.' **** 'good'
---'that one also did not hold a charge very long so i bought yet another battery and still the battery life was short.' **** 'short'
---"so i figured the phone was causing the short battery life (about two days) and i needed to get a new phone.i didn't buy the phone from amazon but wanted to review it so came here to do so.i've always been pleased with the old convoy with a few quirks that i didn't like." **** 'short'
---'easy to recharge: same connector as kindle paperwhite.less camera features than original: lacks zoom and contrast/brightness adjustment.battery life unimpressive: convoy good first few months, convoy 2 okay, not great.sound quality and volume are good: about the same as original.beeps and reacts when in my pocket: to stop it,turn it off.' **** 'unimpressive'
---"it's perfect for someone who needs a solid phone with good battery life and a decent quality camera." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"first i've used it in dirty conditions, also on my boat where my hands were wet, and it has worked flawlessly with the exception of the shorter battery life the past several months." **** 'past'
---"i bought this phone to replace an older convoy with which i was generally satisfied although it started having internal problems after about 2 years.this one not only developed similar problems in about half a year (battery life shortened greatly -- new battery didn't help) but added another problem (cracked external screen) and exaggerated another (external buttons too easily activated.)" **** 'new'
---"battery life is good if it doesn't have to keep searching for service, i can go up to 5 days on a charge but i don't use any internet or music functions either." **** 'good'

Positive Reviews:

---"i've had the original convoy for a little over two years." **** 'original'
---"i am pleased with several aspects of the new convoy 2.here is what i like about the new convoy 2.pros:- the convoy 2 is slightly thinner and perhaps slightly lighter than the convoy 1- i believe the volume is much louder on the convoy 2 than the convoy 1- the convoy 2 has a flash for the camera, but it is easily also used as a flashlight.- the little false buttons on the convoy 1 have been designed out of the convoy 2- the convoy 2 uses a standard usb connector for chargingcons:- both the convoy 1 and convoy 2 are quite thick given the wide variety of phones on the market that have similar features and are much thinner.- strangely the convoy 2 does not have the two small slots next to the battery cover to help removing the cover.don't cares:- the camera." **** 'thinner'
