Positive Reviews:

---'it received the kit kat update to 4.4.3 soon after i purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly.+ wifi connecting/speed of wifi - the strongest wifi yet of any phone that i have owned, and i really am serious!' **** 'strongest'
---'the instructions that came with the phone were easy to use and in just a few minutes i had the phone up and running just fine.what i like about this phone:1 - it is much easier to learn than i thought it would be.2 - phone is very responsive.3 - i like the google player music player--i use a newly purchased bluetooth speaker and the songs really sound great!and i installed amazon mp3 app from the playstore which plays my music from the cloud when i am on wifi or from my sd card when i am off wifi.4 - so far the battery life is very good even when i am on wifi or bluetooth.5 - low cost phone that meets all my needs for a smartphone.6 - wifi is easy to connect, is very strong and has a long range and stays connected without any problems.' **** 'easy'

Negative Reviews:

---"to break it down:+ screen looks great+ great battery life, usually still have 50% left by the end of the day+ takes a 64gb sd card (sandisk - haven't tried other brands)+ good wifi and cell reception+ no noticible delays when running apps+ the mono-speaker gets pretty loud (though it's obviously still a phone speaker, so don't expect miracles)+ feels solid (doesn't feel cheap)- camera doesn't have autofocus." **** 'good'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'opening and closing apps is snappy and smooth enough, and they show on the quite beautiful display.' **** 'enough'
---"it is the first phone i have and i didn't know the operating system and the default apps occupied the other 1.8 gb.it has a micro sd slot that supports a 32 gb sd card, but this space can be used just to save documents, photos, videos, etc." **** 'other'
---"have used this moto e for about a month in korea, and found out moto e is much better than expected..i'm using mostly basic functions of a phone, such as reading short stories, news articles and listening to internet radio under wifi ..this is definitely a wonder-product for its extreme low price..day 1, moto e looked a littler too much simpler than sony or samsung's products out in the market, but is quite fast and smooth.. if you have used google's pad before, it would be easier to get used to this phone, i mean the flow of buttons and icons you need to press.. various free apps were available in android app store to customize the phone for my style.surprising performance perhaps comes from its software and hardware optimized and also from not covering the basic android features with manufacturer's own user interface software's..messages either short or long ones did not cause any problem when this phone connected to the operator network in korea.. i was also satisfied with amazon's quick delivery at the time of purchase..overall, i am more than pleased with this product and ample information given by amazon system before my buying decision.." **** 'free'

Negative Reviews:

---'it stutters only when i have a bunch of apps open as well.' **** 'open'
---'i have it over halfway full now with music and apps and videos and it is working perfectly.my only gripe is that, as others have noted, the back cover of the phone (the part you can change for other colors) has a little bit of wiggle room.' **** 'music'
---'even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen, when i view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful!and the screen is so clear that i can read pdf books using adobe reader and see the pages without my glasses!+ kitkat / pure android experience - since this has the pure android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight android!' **** 'essential'
---'i was able to move more than half of my installed apps so i still have 1.5gb left on my internal space!- no nfc and no otg - this phone will not work with an otg adapter with flash drive and other usb devices.' **** 'able'
