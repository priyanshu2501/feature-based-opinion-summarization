---"if i end up keeping it, on of my next purchases will be for a case with just that.also, for a per-minute phone and the large size of the screen, the text showing how long you've been talking while making a call is cartoonishly tiny with seemingly no way to make it bigger, nor can i find feature on the phone to 'beep' when you're approaching the minute mark on any call." **** 'long'

Positive Reviews:

---'it\'s obviously not practical to have a phone that you must turn off or put into "silent" mode all the time; you will not know if anybody is trying to reach you, which is half the point of having a phone in the first place.i am sincerely surprised that a company as good as samsung would build in such a horrible little feature... and then give you no way to turn it off.' **** 'little'
---'granted, the mp3 feature probably ate that up rather quickly, but at the same time i have a cheap mp3 player laying around that can play for about twice as long before getting to half-charge.' **** 'ate'
---'but overall it is a good feature phone.' **** 'good'
---"i don't know why samsung decided to make a phone with the worst feature ever and then make it impossible to turn that feature off, but i'm guessing that there was a bet with the devil and a beating with a tire iron involved.otherwise, phone seems okay." **** 'worst'
