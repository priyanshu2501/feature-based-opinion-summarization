---"i have shopped, online and in the store at each of the three carrier and finally decided to purchased this unlocked phone and stayed with my carrier rather than switching...sometimes you can't tell by the image until you have the touch and feel of the device in your hand...and i am here to tell you...if you are looking for screen that is bigger than an iphone (i had that) and smaller than a note - look no more...this is your phone...but that's just the physical trait...the processor speed on this thing is phenomenon and the clarity....and the battery life...i have it on for almost 24 hours now...and i still have at least 30% left (but probably because i havent been able to get my data to work yet)...it uses a micro sim (not included) and the unlocked code (included)." **** 'able'
