---'i love this phone because of the easy to use qwerty keyboard.i always call it a wanna be smart phone!this is only the second cell phone i have ever owned...my first one was a samsung flip phone without a camera.if you are looking for a fancy phone then buy one, this is just a nice phone with some nice extras.i love that i can do facebook, email and surf the net at home or in hot spots.it saves a lot of money because you do not have to lock in to an expensive phone plan if you are just looking for a replacement phone....i just used this to replace my old phone.however, what i don\'t like about the phone is that it isn\'t always user friendly, and if you are technically challenged like i am it can get a bit frustrating at times to figure out what you are doing.luckily, if you go to the nokia site you will find a great discussion board where people can give you solutions about how to use this and that option or any problem that come up.the mannual that comes with the phone is useless.i have also called nokia customer service with some questions, and they have been helpful.i must warn that when it says "us version", it really means that it is an international phone with an american adaptor.i didn\'t like this because i thought i was getting a us phone.the seller sent me free of charge an original nokia us charger, i am pleased that he offered to do that.but, the charger cord is a little short which can make it difficult to talk on while it is charging.words like color are colour, favorite is favourite...so uses british english.that doesn\'t bother me so much, though.the apps aren\'t great, but i don\'t really use apps anyway.the numbers are hard to find, but all in all you get used to the quirks and realize that you have a lot for the money.the camera isn\'t bad, but the video is really short.just not as users friendly as i thought it would be, but i would buy it again simply because of internet access, and the qwerty key pad is easy to use.i love texting on this phone, but i had a problem with sending and receiving photos.found out the phone has to be programmed, and you have to either call nokia or find an answer on the nokia discussion board.don\'t be afraid to buy...especially if you know a lot about cell phones or if you have someone who can help you figure it out.my engineer husband helped me get it all set up, but i am still trying to figure out some of the technical issues.sweet little phone for the price.' **** 'original'

---'i love this phone because of the easy to use qwerty keyboard.i always call it a wanna be smart phone!this is only the second cell phone i have ever owned...my first one was a samsung flip phone without a camera.if you are looking for a fancy phone then buy one, this is just a nice phone with some nice extras.i love that i can do facebook, email and surf the net at home or in hot spots.it saves a lot of money because you do not have to lock in to an expensive phone plan if you are just looking for a replacement phone....i just used this to replace my old phone.however, what i don\'t like about the phone is that it isn\'t always user friendly, and if you are technically challenged like i am it can get a bit frustrating at times to figure out what you are doing.luckily, if you go to the nokia site you will find a great discussion board where people can give you solutions about how to use this and that option or any problem that come up.the mannual that comes with the phone is useless.i have also called nokia customer service with some questions, and they have been helpful.i must warn that when it says "us version", it really means that it is an international phone with an american adaptor.i didn\'t like this because i thought i was getting a us phone.the seller sent me free of charge an original nokia us charger, i am pleased that he offered to do that.but, the charger cord is a little short which can make it difficult to talk on while it is charging.words like color are colour, favorite is favourite...so uses british english.that doesn\'t bother me so much, though.the apps aren\'t great, but i don\'t really use apps anyway.the numbers are hard to find, but all in all you get used to the quirks and realize that you have a lot for the money.the camera isn\'t bad, but the video is really short.just not as users friendly as i thought it would be, but i would buy it again simply because of internet access, and the qwerty key pad is easy to use.i love texting on this phone, but i had a problem with sending and receiving photos.found out the phone has to be programmed, and you have to either call nokia or find an answer on the nokia discussion board.don\'t be afraid to buy...especially if you know a lot about cell phones or if you have someone who can help you figure it out.my engineer husband helped me get it all set up, but i am still trying to figure out some of the technical issues.sweet little phone for the price.' **** 'bad'
---'is working ok.no problems.good functionality and wifi is very useful.the quality of the photos and other camera related extras are not good' **** 'other'
---"the phone is great for basic using, keyboard is awesome, screen is big but not very high quality but it is cool, sound, music, s40 os, everything works great, the phone feels very nicethe only bad is the camera, it sucks, even with good light it sucks, it's like vga res upscaled to 2mp, it just sucks even on last fw,that aside the phone is great" **** 'bad'

---'with dedicated number keys, 1-0, it was impossible to type in the letters because on my old phone an \'f\' is on the \'3\' key, but on this phone, with the control-key activating the numbers, the \'f\' key is on the \'4\' key; not at all linear, and the \'y" key is not connected to a number at all.' **** 'impossible'

Negative Reviews:

---"*crisis*) and everything that you need is there!the downside- it can't read pdf files, can't play angrybirds (hey beggars aren't choosers) and most games, so if you're a major cell phone gamer- go spend more money to get something better, otherwise, for people who just needs a stylish phone to socialize, this phone is more than enough for you!" **** 'major'
---'i love this phone because of the easy to use qwerty keyboard.i always call it a wanna be smart phone!this is only the second cell phone i have ever owned...my first one was a samsung flip phone without a camera.if you are looking for a fancy phone then buy one, this is just a nice phone with some nice extras.i love that i can do facebook, email and surf the net at home or in hot spots.it saves a lot of money because you do not have to lock in to an expensive phone plan if you are just looking for a replacement phone....i just used this to replace my old phone.however, what i don\'t like about the phone is that it isn\'t always user friendly, and if you are technically challenged like i am it can get a bit frustrating at times to figure out what you are doing.luckily, if you go to the nokia site you will find a great discussion board where people can give you solutions about how to use this and that option or any problem that come up.the mannual that comes with the phone is useless.i have also called nokia customer service with some questions, and they have been helpful.i must warn that when it says "us version", it really means that it is an international phone with an american adaptor.i didn\'t like this because i thought i was getting a us phone.the seller sent me free of charge an original nokia us charger, i am pleased that he offered to do that.but, the charger cord is a little short which can make it difficult to talk on while it is charging.words like color are colour, favorite is favourite...so uses british english.that doesn\'t bother me so much, though.the apps aren\'t great, but i don\'t really use apps anyway.the numbers are hard to find, but all in all you get used to the quirks and realize that you have a lot for the money.the camera isn\'t bad, but the video is really short.just not as users friendly as i thought it would be, but i would buy it again simply because of internet access, and the qwerty key pad is easy to use.i love texting on this phone, but i had a problem with sending and receiving photos.found out the phone has to be programmed, and you have to either call nokia or find an answer on the nokia discussion board.don\'t be afraid to buy...especially if you know a lot about cell phones or if you have someone who can help you figure it out.my engineer husband helped me get it all set up, but i am still trying to figure out some of the technical issues.sweet little phone for the price.' **** 'second'
