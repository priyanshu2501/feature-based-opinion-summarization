---"( does have a nice automatic eco mode you can set up to kick in when its running low to maximize battery life)also the screen quality would never be called hd, but watching stuff on netflix and even editing instagram pics works fine.oh that brings me to the camera, its fine, not great, not bad, pretty much on par for android cameras and great for everyday facebooking or instagram.so you get a great mp3 player running your favorite android with expandable memory apps for about $40.that alone would make it an instant buy.but then the final kicker, the thing is waterproof so if you're walking outside and it starts raining you don't have to worry!definitely would buy again!" **** 'favorite'

Positive Reviews:

---'there is a pitiful player by samsung that costs several hundred and still only runs gingerbread 2.3.the most appalling part is their website dedicated to convincing you that paying hundreds for an outdated operating system is a good thing!anyway this phone can take a 32 gig sd card for storing music, pictures, apps, and more.it runs a nearly unskinned version of ice cream sandwich save for the lock screen which is fine.all my favorite apps have been compatible, google voice for texts, groove ip make phone calls over wifi, google music copies your entire music collection over from your computer (it also regularly updates new podcasts from itunes) and often has great deals on new music to add to your collection.' **** 'favorite'

__________('waterproof',)__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"i still think this may be getting caused by the battery saver app but i've taken those off and tried different ones and the problem still exists, tried a bluetooth fixer or two off google store but that doesn't seem to have fixed it either.i love the phone, for the price it's a great phone, plenty of memory, peppy, the waterproof is nice and the price is right." **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---"bringing it back three days after i bought it i was told i should have added the five dollars a month insurance (with a $65.00 deductible on a $130.00 pos phone)!i may save some money with boost, but i won't be doing it with this phone." **** 'told'

__________('kyocera',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i dropped sprint and switched to boost mobile, going from an htc evo 4g to the new kyocera hydro.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---'but just about any hybrid case also available here at amazon should resolve that issue.the microsd card does set underneath the battery, so there goes any chance of hot swapping the card for another.the battery cover lock is not that easy to unlock with your thumbnail, but a dime fits in it perfectly.all in all the kyocera hydro is a good mid-level phone that is great for anybody that goes outdoors frequently, and i will highly recommend this phone or the new kyocera hydro edge.' **** 'new'
---'if i ever try to buy a kyocera phone or use boost mobile again i want someone to just punch me in the face instead.' **** 'try'
