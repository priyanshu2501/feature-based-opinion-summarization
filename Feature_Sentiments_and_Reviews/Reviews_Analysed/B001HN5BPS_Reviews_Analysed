---"i am also rather tech savvy, at an intermediate/expert level.blackberry storm 9350!i'll give you a bottom line right off the bat for this product:if you want a phone for it's entertainment and good - not the best - business applications i would go with the storm.if you want a hardcore business phone go with the curve or bold as it's more suitable for emails and is much faster to type with if your on the go.the reason why i say this is because this is the first blackberry with so many entertainment features like free news sent right to you phone you just click on to read, your own customizable ring tones, an amazing screen for ultimate video, a great camera (takes some time to actually take the picture but it's the same with other quality cell phone camera's), great email abilities, coming out with good applications making it a formidable foe to the iphone once again, free google maps and other browsers for your various needs, including the firefox alpha and opera mini!the only cons that i have found with this phone have been the fact that not as many applications that i'd like to get have been released, but that is not the phone's problem since it hasn't been out very long." **** 'first'

---'luckily, a friend of mine talked me out of getting the iphone (then after messing around my new blackberry storm the day i purchased it, he made the switch the very next day as well).-learning curve: if you are an iphone user it may take some time getting used to the blackberry storm, but having never owned an iphone, i found the storm itself incredibly easy and intuitive to use.-stability: i hear nothing but complaints from friends and family over the iphone constantly crashing, dropping calls, and losing outgoing emails or texts.' **** 'new'
---"i do find the maps and gps navigation on the blackberry to be comparable to the iphone, so perhaps as time goes by we can expect some more decent apps to come down the pipeline.-voice quality: it can often be tough for people to hear me unless i speak directly into the mouth piece (which pulls the phone away from my ear so i can't hear them), but the iphone is even worse." **** 'comparable'
---'to avoid being dainty or obscure--- first download the latest version before trying to use the blackberry storm!update march 17, 2009: i also hear they have a new firmware update coming out soon that should help improve the acceleramator and camera.initial impressionsat first glance the new blackberry storm was only ok. i guess i expected a form factor that was bit more revolutionary.' **** 'new'

---"i didn't have anything worth using heavily on my storm to really drain it, so i'm not a totally fair judge of this, but it seemed that the storm's battery life is quite decent, and probably better than the iphone 3g for general use.additionally, having a removable battery is a very nice feature... albeit one i don't really care much about, since i generally have some type of charger near me, whether it's in a car, my desk at work, or an outlet at home.general impressions / in closingso, you're wondering after reading this, do i recommend the blackberry storm to anyone?my short answer: no.my longer answer: the phone isn't refined enough." **** 'nice'
---'the build quality, battery life, removable battery and memory card, ability to open word and excel files, and great speaker are just a few of the awesome feature of this phone.the bad...there is a learning curve with this phone.' **** 'bad'
---'let me give a run down of its pros and cons.pros:-it has great reception (the most important feature seeing as its a phone).-its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-decent internet speed, even indoors.-good mp3 and video playing capabilities, on par with the iphone i tried.-a great camera as far as phones go.' **** 'important'

Positive Reviews:

---'typing on the qwerty screen works best, but errors are continuous and time-consuming.- two hands are required to operate phone at all times- operations are mysteriously slow at time.' **** 'best'
---'much better sound than an ipod/phone... and the camera is one of the best i have ever seen on a phone.plenty of apps and it is fast, browser works well.i am very happy with mine.' **** 'happy'

Positive Reviews:

---'having previously used a voyager which requires a physical push of the screen to recognize anything, this electrical type of interface is much easier.' **** 'electrical'
---'iphone is the easiest to type among the phones with on-screen keyboard.' **** 'easiest'

Negative Reviews:

---'i found it very difficult to type fast on this phone.' **** 'difficult'
---"this is important, because it means you can't use touch to type." **** 'important'

__________('browser',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the browser is pretty good, much better than previous bb browsers, even better than the one in the bold.' **** 'good'
---"maybe they will put a trackball on the next storm, or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone.i wont even mention the slow camera, check error, random reboots, slow accelerometer, bad browser, etc since those things may get fixed if they haven't been already." **** 'bad'

Negative Reviews:

---"not the greatest when the days of the human operator are in the past.the blackberry internet browser isn't nearly as good as the browser on android or the iphone." **** 'good'
---"sure you can download another browser, but they're still not as good." **** 'good'
---"(trapster, nav4all..etc)- full html browsings  (if bb browser doesn't do it for you, check out bolt browser)- being able to just drag&drop; movies, songs, ringtones, pics straight into storm without 3rd party app." **** 'able'
---"the browser is nice but many pages still don't render properly due to the size and the lack of usability of some sites.for me, it seemed that at the most critical times the phone locked up." **** 'nice'
---'so do not despair if you need your fixes - with the new browser and some patience you can always get to do what you want if you are willing.rss readers:i am a huge fan of rss feeds - i think the advent of google reader added to my daily things to do has haled the time to stay on top of current issues and events.' **** 'new'

---"something about the screen is simply superior (it also handles sunlight much better, so you aren't left running for shade when watching video or messaging).-apps: this is where the iphone really shines, and why i consider it more of a toy." **** 'much'
---'obviously not a replacement for a stand alone camera, but no phone camera is.-unlike my old curve you can use the built in gps without paying for vznavigator.-bright, clear screen that is much better looking than the iphone i tried.-sleek look.-its a blackberry, previous and current bb users will find a lot of familier features here.-does not require itunes, but it supports it if you wish to use it.cons:-its slow.' **** 'much'

Positive Reviews:

---"probably the best i've ever had with a rim device." **** 'best'
---'multimedia on the device is good.' **** 'good'
---"they have a nice little sync app, now my google calendar and contacts are live on the storm.i imagine you'll find a different set of features that you care about, but basically, this has become an amazingly powerful device, well beyond what i expected when i bought it.if you can get used to the typing, i think you'll love it too." **** 'powerful'
---'the battery had to be removed and replaced to reset the phone.the phone is also heavy for a portable device.' **** 'portable'
---'(let us all hope)there are definitely many more application out there but for the fear of breaking the new device i will keep it minimal for the time and get used to the email deluge each day.' **** 'new'
---'its more money but worth it in my opinion.twitterberry (for the twitter user:links: [...]in summary (at least up till this point):i am pretty happy with the device in general - there are things i would love to see released now and i know i will have to wait for but eventually all the applications will catch up, the case options will catch up and my fingers will figure out how in the heck to use the blackberry sure type keyboard (that is the strangest thing i have ever used)i will go up against the critics that compare it to the iphone of today as the iphone of today is multiple software revisions and an entire model revised.' **** 'happy'
---'first of all, i am a gadget-freak and i think that the bb (other than the storm) is, hands-down, the best phone/email device ever.' **** 'best'
---"you have a problem with your phone - try taking it to verizon store!anyway, just update your os and spend a little time getting used to it - you'll have the best mobile device you've ever owned." **** 'best'
---'typing is a bit slower than i would like, but i am also hoping that as i use the device more, i will get better and more accurate at it.' **** 'better'
---'typing is a bit slower than i would like, but i am also hoping that as i use the device more, i will get better and more accurate at it.' **** 'accurate'

Negative Reviews:

---"again, another thing i believe rim decided to copy from the iphone (even though the iphone is not the first device to use something like this, it's the first one to do it right in my opinion.)" **** 'first'
---"but when you try either of these devices and then try the bb, you'll immediately feel you've taken several steps backward.the omnia is the same thing: a nice, elegant, clean and usable device that does everything i had hoped the bb would accomplish." **** 'clean'
---"in fact, behind the the pretty interface, the apps are nearly identical to that found on the curve or pearl.as you've likely noticed already, this device has been getting either lauded...or blasted...depending on who you talk to." **** 'lauded'
---'the case is flimsy and i do not know how people test cases but its a touch device - if you touch it it gets fingerprints and you will need to wipe the crud off at some point - with the silicon case that fits like a floppy flyer you will more than likely wrap the case around the back of the phone when you go to wipe it off.' **** 'touch'
---'make sure you get a device that works.' **** 'sure'
---"the good news is that it survived every fall.but let's talk about that pretty face-- the vibrancy and crispness of the storm's colorful screen really is unrivaled in a small device." **** 'small'

---'extensive typing is much more efficient on a device with a full button keyboard.' **** 'much'

Positive Reviews:

---"yes if you're trying to run 10 apps at once it's going to lag pretty bad, but it is not much different than windows os." **** 'bad'
---'apps for the blackberry is a relatively new thing but there are new apps added daily.' **** 'new'
---"there aren't too many free apps available either." **** 'free'
---'the surrounding apps are solid.' **** 'solid'
---'its now really easy to text, apps work smoothly, and let me tell you.... it has become an iphone killer.' **** 'easy'
---"as your first smartphone, you're excited by the new apps and abilities but after the 30 day grace period that you can return the phone is up, the reality of this phone hits hard." **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---"whatever you do, if you get this phone, don't look at the apps available for the iphone or android phones, you'll be very disappointed." **** 'available'
---'apps for the blackberry is a relatively new thing but there are new apps added daily.' **** 'daily'
---"i do find the maps and gps navigation on the blackberry to be comparable to the iphone, so perhaps as time goes by we can expect some more decent apps to come down the pipeline.-voice quality: it can often be tough for people to hear me unless i speak directly into the mouth piece (which pulls the phone away from my ear so i can't hear them), but the iphone is even worse." **** 'decent'
---"there aren't too many free apps available either." **** 'available'
---'i look forward to seeing what other apps blackberry comes out with for this device.' **** 'other'
---"there are not nearly as many apps available as there are for the iphone (that's putting it mildly), but theoretically, most of the tasks that iphone apps perform can now be accomplished through corresponding storm apps." **** 'available'

__________('mail',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'there should be a way to either check for mail less frequently, or to notify you only at certain times.' **** 'less'
---'if this phone worked as it should it would be acceptable at best, but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to avoid.the email feature is very good, although it only checks for email from most isp servers every 15 minutes, and there is no way to force it check for new mail at your convenience.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---'i\'m not suggesting verizon has best coverage in your area..  i\'m sure there are areas verizon lacks coverage where others excel at.- instant email & blackberry messenger  (2 things that no other phones can compare/compete with and what makes it my "crackberry")- being able to use aim, yahoo msger, google talk all simultaneously  (waiting on jivetalk to come out with  the update, which will enable me to use 1 program for all im programs)- visual voice mail(being able to check vmail without having to call in...shows lengh of msg, who it\'s from..etc before you even check the actual message)- shooting videos, being able to upload online(eg.' **** 'able'
