Positive Reviews:

---"to recap the positives:- great voice quality- exceptional speakerphone- touchstone integration is very nice- music player has replaced 2 ipods- best-in-class web browser- easy multi-tasking- very good camera- physical keyboard- universal search- gps-based turn-by-turn directions- great applications out of the box (youtube, google maps, sprint nfl)- 3rd-party applications are universally great (tweed, pandora & accuweather are among my faves)- awesome alert system- replaceable battery- charges over standard micro-usb connector- can be used as usb thumb drive- good bluetooth support- battery life is good even under moderate-to-heavy usage- the slider means that the phone slips easily & unobtrusively into any pocketthings that should be improved soon- more applications in the app catalog- better signal strengthreally, that's it." **** 'good'
---"threaded messaging is also really nice, although sprint's mms implementation seems a bit flakey.battery life could be better, and reception could be as well, but i mostly blame the reception on sprint, and the battery life seems to be very much a factor of how good the reception is." **** 'better'
---'luckily, the battery is removable, and extended-life batteries are available.' **** 'removable'

Negative Reviews:

---"the phone functions are still not quite as polished as the centro (beeping for missed calls, messages, etc) but it is pretty good and reliable now.battery life is better now, especially now that i know to turn off data radio and roaming if in a rural metal building (one of my outreach clinics) so it doesn't drain itself.i really like the way it bluetooth audios and phones with my ford escape hybrid computer, so i can listen to pandora and make calls hands-free while driving." **** 'good'

---'the review in one run-on sentence: form factor is great, and it is a very usable smart phone with some great features that truly take advantage of wireless connectivty, but hindered by weak battery life (that may improve when palm fixes a bug on the phone).i am going to talk about general impressions of the phone first, then give some specific info about how the phone suits dedicated palm users at the end of the review.i love the form factor.' **** 'weak'
---"at this point i really don't know if palm can do anything more to improve the battery life and i have a feeling i'll be looking at getting a spare battery or an extended one at some point in the future.on the day the pre went on sale there were 18 apps available via the app catalog on the device." **** 'extended'
---"!here's the quick and dirty check list...pros:beautiful physical designmulti-taskingease of syncing and backing up contact informationgreat web browserexcellent email and messaging optionseasy to read screencons:poor battery lifepoor app selections at this timelack of camera options and video recordingserious limitations in the classic app and it's high costi like the palm pre and i want to love it because i can see just how much potential this new platform from palm has." **** 'poor'
---"what i've come to realize is that 3g phones like the iphone, android phones and the palm pre don't offer good battery life." **** 'good'
---'it is so neat.cons:battery life: if you are a heavy user you will need an extended battery and currently none of the extended batteries support the wireless chargerit can lag at times which is annoying.lastly the "living in the cloud" idea is awesome, but make sure you use some kind of backup software, they don\'t really have the whole cloud thing figured out perfectly yet.' **** 'extended'
---'other notable enhancements are *much* faster performance in opening apps and better battery life.' **** 'better'
---'my other phone was a motorola from sprint, and in the same location it had 5 bars, the pre only has 1-2.battery life needs to be longer.' **** 'longer'

Positive Reviews:

Negative Reviews:

---'and even if there was a problem sprint has been very good about replacing defective handsets.pros: camera quality is great in sunlight, multitasking (even if it might slow down the phone a tad), web browser (great browser, just sometimes slows to a crawl if a website has too many moving graphics), keyboard (once you get used to it), sprint network in phoenix (havent dropped a call or lost signal yet)cons: camera quality in night shots (flash not that bright), oreo effect (the slider hinge when closed allows the phone to slightly move from side to side), screen size (its not really a con, but it would be nice if it was bigger), app store (getting better but still needs a lot more apps)i know i listed a few cons but i really do love this phone.' **** 'better'
---"although the app store is still small compared to the itunes catalog, the phone's hardware is comparable to the iphone 3gs, so there are some high-quality apps including many of the best games for the iphone (assassin's creed, hero of sparta, etc.)" **** 'small'
