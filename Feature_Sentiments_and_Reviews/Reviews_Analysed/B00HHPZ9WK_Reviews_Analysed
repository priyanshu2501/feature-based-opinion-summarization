Positive Reviews:

---'Have only been using the phone for a couple days but battery life seems better than that of the 2x as expensive sony xperia TL which I had previously.' **** 'better'
---"It is a very nice phone but what I didn't like is that it has a default Chinese web browser, I got rid of it first but it keeps coming back, I hate it.. Secondly, the battery life doesn't last long even if its on standby.. And last thing, the camera for first time use was horrible, it has some thousands of dead pixel, so I just kept trying to use the camera for 3 days and it was fine now, not as clear as my sony ericson 8mp though even if this phone have 8mp, its not good quality when it comes to a camera... All in all great phone for what I paid for..." **** 'long'
