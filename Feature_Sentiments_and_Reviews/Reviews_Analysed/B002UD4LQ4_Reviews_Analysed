Negative Reviews:

---"!-very slow, compared to other cheaper bb's (when i bought it, was priced at $450 the cheapest)-when you need it the most for a phone call, bb chat or taking a pic, the phone has the freakin' small clock on as if it froze on you-can't use privacy screen protectors since they are too rough making the screen impossible to use-very heavy when compared to other bb's-in edge with normal use (e-mails, bb chat, msn, facebook) won't last half a day with all battery saving tips and techniques listed on all crackberry and blackberry forums...-signal strength improved a tad with os 5.0 but still softer than my bb8900 which at the same places under the same circumstances get better signal and better battery life.verdict:i sold the phone for $150 in mint condition and unlocked to a friend of mine after doing a complete phone swipe and hard reset." **** 'better'
