---'there are no &#34;good&#34; apps for stocks, few news apps, very few apps overall for the 808.' **** 'overall'
---'it is slow, clunky, with ugly fonts and icons, almost impossible to use browser, unstable and crash prone, still uses a very archaic 360p resolution, canno scale to modern hardware, and is bogged down with the need for legacy support and poor apps.' **** 'poor'
---"now compare that with apple and you realize the substantial accomplishments that are still being made at the finnish phone giant, despite the fact that elop really made a big strategic gaff in announcing that symbian would be ditched when he did.in terms of the phone itself, rather than re-hash what others have said, i will just do my own list of pros and cons:pros- the camera (unparalled)- nokia maps (excellent)- the playback sound quality (very good)- the speaker ( - loudest and best quality i've heard in any phone)- the battery life (very good)- the removable battery (great for long trips when you can carry a charged replacement)- the ability to add a substantial amount of memory- the wide range of (very good) social media apps available on nokia app storecons- does not always charge when connected to mains ( - don't know why this is)- limited apps ( - for example no gas station price location app)- muffled sound when receiving calls which makes it hard to hear sometimes, particularly on international calls- the bulge in the phone where the camera and sensor are, which really requires a case, and for some reason (unlike with the n9), nokia didn't provide one with the phone, which given how much you're paying, i think they should have done.- very occasional symbian freezes, which then require a reboot- the virtual keyboard, which even with swype, makes writing a message much more laborious compared with my previous phone, the nokia n9 ( - hopefully this con will be fixed with an update)given the substantial pros of this phone, i can live with the niggling cons, and would fully recommend anyone wanting a better than average cameraphone or versatile smartphone to look into getting this phone.really, if you think about it the future is bright for nokia - just imagine it - a windows 8 pureview phone - it will crush the windows 8 competition, which really is the reason that this phone marks another turning point for the finnish phone giant." **** 'available'
---'some of these edit functions appear to be folded into the camera or other apps.' **** 'other'
---"however you can't unplug completely even if you want to.that's why i decided to go for the nokia 808. i wanted something that can keep me online if i need to, to have the freedom to use the device in any country i may roam around the globe, the best native apps for your daily needs (nokia maps - offline!!!" **** 'best'
