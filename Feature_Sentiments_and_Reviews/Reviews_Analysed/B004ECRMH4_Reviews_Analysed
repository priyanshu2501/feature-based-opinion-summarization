Negative Reviews:

---"call quality was good, though compared with my previous phone (lg incite), the microphone is not as sensitive.pros:quality phone hardwarekeyboard and trackball qualityscreen resolutiondecent auto focus camera with led flashmicrosd support (up to 16gb)miniusb--a standard and common connectorcons:dead closed hiptop platform (no external sources of obtaining programs)crippled bluetooth services (no proper file transfer, just sending files to the phone)don't expect wifi, as that was left out of the design.if you never use data services, such as mobile web and email, and tend to text more than you make calls, the sidekick lx 2009 should be worth looking into--especially if you are a prepaid customer and would rather not settle with a similarly priced lg neon or a samsung t369 (both are messaging phones).the particular sidekick i picked up was new-old-stock (retail starter kit) and was unlocked--though it was missing the 1gb microsd card." **** 'worth'
