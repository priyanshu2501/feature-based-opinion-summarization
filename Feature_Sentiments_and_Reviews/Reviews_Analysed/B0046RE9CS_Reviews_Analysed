---'This is my first smartphone and the experience with the C6-01 was not great; main reasons are:+ has simbian, so apps availability is limited+ a couple of times the phone has stopped working and only way to solve the issue was to leave it empty the energy of the battery for a full day and then recharge to reset, which left me complete days without cellphone+ web navigation is not fast+ mail app is really slow (I do not use mails frequently in the cell so I was not really affected by this but could be a real problem)What I do like of the cell is that:+ it has radio+ you can connect a micro sd card to expand memory+ its a small smartphone+ its well built and durable+ has good phone functionality!!!!!' **** 'first'
