Positive Reviews:

---")+ night video was all right (but absence of auto-focus is generally annoying).i bought c6-01 as a secondary small phone for long-distance running with music, for tracking and recording my training (they have a nice ovi-app for that), for free maps and navigation without data plan, because i like to explore unknown areas, and for having an emergency communication possibility - well, what's the point if i cannot listen to my music even staying still and have unreliable gps?..i hope it may help somebody to avoid time wasting (i am sorry about mine)." **** 'free'
---'the only things i miss are the autofocus for the camera (good pics anyway) and a version of skype for symbian^3 that allows to make video calls (so far is just possible to make calls through skype).the dimension is perfect, i can do almost everything with one hand.i am getting used to the "swipe" writing technology and is fast and comfortable.i like the free maps and the possiblity to use ovi maps as a gps without using any network (at the beginning takes a while to find me, but then works like any tom tom or garmin, but for free on your phone)too bad that nokia is kind of excluded from usa market and also the symbian apps are not so many as the android and apple.in conclusion a great phone for who doesn\'t want to spend too much and doesn\'t want to renounce to anything.' **** 'free'

---'the turn-by-turn advice, however, more than occasionally gets confused if there are lots of streets in the same area, but the maps are good enough that one can take a quick look at them and figure out which way to go, when the voice (of which there are many to choose from) fails.the gps seems to have been improved in the various upgrades over the past year, and its locating ability and maps are very useful.it is an excellent phone and mp3 player, those parts are very user friendly; a very good camera, decent internet device, and much improved gps system, good although not yet for foolproof turn by turn advice.' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"i'm a nokia user since the 1100. this is my first smartphone and the experience with the c6-01 was not great; main reasons are:+ has simbian, so apps availability is limited+ a couple of times the phone has stopped working and only way to solve the issue was to leave it empty the energy of the battery for a full day and then recharge to reset, which left me complete days without cellphone+ web navigation is not fast+ mail app is really slow (i do not use mails frequently in the cell so i was not really affected by this but could be a real problem)what i do like of the cell is that:+ it has radio+ you can connect a micro sd card to expand memory+ its a small smartphone+ its well built and durable+ has good phone functionality!!!!" **** 'complete'
---"!the nokia brand is not fashionable these days but it's a shame... they make the best phones." **** 'fashionable'
