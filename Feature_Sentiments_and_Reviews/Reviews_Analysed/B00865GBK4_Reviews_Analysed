---"if you buy this phone you can't activate on straight talk, i've has it a month and how i regret buying it just to save a fee dollars, been without service to call out for times this month called last night to get tech to reactivate, that's what i have to do every time i can't call out, and thus morning i have no service again so i have to call from other phone to get service again, yes i wish i would have just gone to walmart to buy my phone" **** 'straight'
---"if you're looking to get an android from straight talk...please...make sure it's one like this that uses verizon (they have the red coverage map on the front of the box)  the ones that piggy back off at&t; and sprint can have horrible reception if you don't live in the right area.$45 a month for unlimited talk, text and data on verizon's network is an absolute steal." **** 'straight'
