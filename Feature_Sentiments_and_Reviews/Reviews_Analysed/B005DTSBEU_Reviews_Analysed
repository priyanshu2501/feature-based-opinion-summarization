---'if this phone got good reception it would be absolutely perfect.' **** 'good'
---"like the other reviews mentioned the battery life is a little short but you have to take in to account how much you are using your phone; however you can pull up your task manger to close unused apps.->the reception is good but i'm going to give that time since the hurricane knocked out most of the power." **** 'good'
---'which means i was probably speaking to a call center in another country which could have caused the poor reception.' **** 'poor'
---"i didn't really cover the fact that it has worse reception than my previous virgin mobile phone, optimus v, and because of that i never made that much phone calls from it." **** 'worse'
---"don't buy this phone.cons:very short battery lifenon responsive and slowwifi shuts down randomlyphone reboots randomlyno regular updates from motoroalworst of all: poor reception." **** 'poor'
---"this alone was not a show stopper but considered along with the weak reception became deal breaker.i readily admit that i could have received a phone that for some reason did not receive as well as it should have, but the idea of returning it and trying another was not appealing, so i simply returned it.i'm back using the optimus (which is smaller and easier to carry) but with limited typing ability.i think the major point though is that virgin mobile has enough sense to sell their phones and then offer no-contract service." **** 'weak'

---'i suggest if you want to try this phone, buy it from a store with a 30 day return policy so if you get bad reception you can take it back.' **** 'bad'
---"little did i knowthat i wouldn't be able to get good reception with thisphone.im at work and can only receive text messages and wheni talking on this phone after work the conversation is distorded and the other party always say they can't here me and my volume is at it's max.i'm left with a phone that i can't use." **** 'able'

---"i think it depends on your area, and the phone's reception is not defective but not top of class either.here is a caveat to this as a complaint: as cell phones transmit their location to towers as they receive, and of course when transmitting, it is possible that reception issues inherent to this phone may have little to do with a bad antenna design and instead that the triumph had less transmitting power back to the tower." **** 'possible'
---"the only real problem i have with the phone is that it does run on sprint towers, so it doesn't have very good reception." **** 'good'

---'that makes it pretty difficult to use for driving, even if you have gm up and running when you start the car.it does have much bigger internal memory, and it can run a few apps much better than the optimus did, however.one of these is caustic for android, a synth/sequencer app.' **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---"some of the persistent problems reported by many people are:1. gps flaky and takes a long time to lock on (open source developers report agps has never worked on the triumph, cold gps locks take 1-3 minutes)2. touchscreen misses or ignores often (even on completely rewritten touchscreen driver)3. capacitive buttons freeze up occasionally (same problem in different roms)4. running out of internal memory due to some logging mechanism that fills up internal storage and can't be turned off except by factory reset (only on stock rom)5. a lot of devices have cameras that take pictures with a green blob in the center in indoor lighting (i have this problem no matter what camer app is used)6. charging port goes bad prematurely (i have to jiggle mine carefully)7. light leakage from bottom capacitive button leds when screen has dark background.i've noticed most of the good reviews are from people either new to android or coming from the intercept (which was a very poor phone to start with)." **** 'due'
---"nevertheless, how much usable *internal* memory you have is critical, because 1) many apps are not movable to the sd card, regardless of what version of android you're running, 2) many apps only have full functionality if you're keeping them on the phone's internal memory (this most commonly comes up for apps that have widget functionality - the widgets cannot be used if the app is on the sd card), and 3) even when you move an app to the sd card, all apps *still* leave portions of themselves on the internal memory." **** 'much'

---'as with so many others, i had and was content with the lg optimus v. but a positive cnet review (what a sucker!' **** 'content'

Negative Reviews:

---"i also find that the zoom is horrible, you try to zoom into a still shot and it will just blur the image.pros- powerful and fast.- quality screen/video.- quality speakers/audio.- forward and front facing cameras.cons- camcorder lacks tremendously.- gps can flake out.- android 2.2 has occasional hiccups and app crashing.- capacitive keys freeze up.a very solid phone, and i'm going to stick with it until virgin decides to release the lg optimus black , which stands to offer everything the triumph does with a crisper lcd display and a much nicer 720p camera/camcorder." **** 'black'
---'this sensor is meant to turn your screen off when making a call, not when using the keypad.went back to my tried and true lg optimus v. i praise vm for the many, gee whiz, smartphones we can now choose from but i will use the optimus v till the software is out of date.' **** 'true'

---"second, unlike the lg optimus v, it doesn't correctly handle numbers with the us country code in the phone book (i.e., numbers +1 ...); it tries to dial them as 011-1-....  since a bunch of the numbers in my phone book come from other sources (e.g., facebook), this is quite a pain.while i like this as an android device, i'm considering returning it because of its inability to function as a phone." **** 'second'
---'i previously had their lg optimus v android phone which i like just fine with the exception that my hands are too big for the keyboard.so, i ordered the motorola triumph from amazon hoping that it would have exactly the same functionality as the optimus and a larger screen.indeed, the screen was larger and the keyboard worked just fine.' **** 'larger'
---"reception is perhaps slightly worse than the lg optimus (based on the number of bars), but i have had no problems with it.some words about the plan (as of august 2011): at the increased price of $35/month, virgin mobile's service is still a good deal." **** 'worse'

---'if you are one of the lucky people to get in on their $25/month plan (less if you buy your refills online with coupons/discounts) then to keep being grandfathered in at that price you must upgrade now.the choice came down to the motorola triumph or the much lauded optimus v. i suggest stopping by your local target so you can fondle the different phones.' **** 'less'

---"i was an early adopter of this phone model with virgin mobile.the screen was bright and large for a prepaid carrier's phone and it had just about all features that android 2.2 could offer.the one i had was a total piece of garbage in my opinion.it worked great for about 3 or 4 months just long enough to exceed return time.then it began to have problems the biggest of which was the darn thing would not charge.so i sent it back to motorola for warranty repairs and that is when the fun began.you know the phrase not worth the paper it is written on.that is how i feel about most warranties.i am not sure if motorola treats all its customers the way i was treated but buddy i was shocked how bad it was.so they received the phone and held onto it for about 2 months.i called and asked why it had not been returned and they said they were waiting on parts.so rather than make a happy customer and just send a replacement phone.i guess they decided they wanted a p*ssed off former customer instead.all they had to do was send me a working phone that i had paid for and provide a little customer service and i would have walked away happy.i felt like the reps at the motorola support lacked any customer service training or experience at all.when the phone was finally returned it was replaced by a refurb phone.this phone did not have the charging issue but had other issues of its own.i will personally never knowingly buy another motorola product as long as i live.so again if you think this is a bargain, i would say think again.knowing what i know now i would never recommend this phone model or motorola to anyone.motorola's support for this product is lacking in my opinion and i cannot help think it reflects badly on motorola as a whole.this phone looks great but it is totally lacking in substance and follow through.i have heard some say this was actually made in china.i don't know if this is true or not but it would certainly explain a lot.i put 1 star but it should probably be a half star cause it worked for 4 months before becoming useless." **** 'bright'
