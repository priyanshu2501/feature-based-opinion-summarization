Negative Reviews:

---"i dropped my phone from about 4 feet in a $50 retail protective case and it still cracked the screen around the edges - i have never cracked another phone's screen in my life and this cracked within 1 month and in a high end screen.software: as mentioned above, apple has the best software that provides a smooth and fast experience and apps look better on this than they did no android even with more powerful phones." **** 'best'
---'this phone was made to kill off the iphone 5 to allow apple to sell a phone with better margins and easier manufacturing via a plastic case and yet they kept the price high for a "new" product that basically came out in 2012. there is no siri, and it is the largest and heaviest of the iphone 5 series.pros: overall decent phone, ios 7 is nice and software is smooth, camera is good, has a lot of good accessories since it is a big name phonecons: very overpriced for what you get, plastic body is cheap and slippery, no siri, great resolution but 4 inches is beginning to look small on phones, larger and heavier than the other 5 models, iphone is still very prone to cracking/shattering screen, nothing really new: this product was created to improve apple\'s business strategy and not out of innovation, anyone who buys this is overpaying so apple can keep margins healthy for investors.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---"this one, i have preordered as well, and i'm going to judge this as an average consumer with the specifications that apple has provided:pros:-wayy cheaper: $99 with 2 year contract-a lot more colorful: the new iphone 5c comes in 5 colors: green, blue, yellow, red, whitea lot more durable: for those you guys that drop you iphone a lot, this thing isn't going to break as fast as the iphone 4, 4s, or even iphone 5. it contains metal reinforcements inside the outer shell.- ios 7: alright, this is one of the biggest improvements that apple has made, the new ios 7 looks a lot more professional than the previous version, they have included a lot more apps that come inbuilt and gives the iphone 5c a new look overall- wallpaper: apple has now integrated what they have been doing with their ipod nanos, which is to give the same colored background as the device which does make the phone look a lot more cooler-a6 chip: this means that the iphone 5c is going to have better battery life, namely, 10 hours lte browsing time, 10 hours talk time, and 10 hours video playback timecons:i can not think of any considering this is only an improvement from the previous models but: know that there is a iphone 5s that is coming out too, so if you want to be top notch, you might want to look into that" **** 'new'
