---"this phone is a turd.pros:- battery life- speaker phone works alrightcons:- very counter-intuitive ui- unable to switch to an incoming call, it tells you about the call, but gives you no options to switch- if you have a missed call there's no easy way to dismiss the message, you have to go into the call log, then switch to missed calls, then it will make the message go away- if you receive a new text message and click on view message it takes you to the last message you were looking at- sometimes the phone takes a long time to respond to commands- camera quality is not good, there is no flashmy advice, don't buy this phone." **** 'long'
