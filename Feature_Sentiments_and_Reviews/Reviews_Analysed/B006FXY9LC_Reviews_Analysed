---"this phone isn't even worth one star.the verizon droid 4 is one of the very worst phones i've ever had the displeasure of owning or using.problem one: if your using an app or playing a game it overheats to the point where you can't touch it, it gets so hot literally within minutes of usage.problem two: poor battery life." **** 'poor'

Negative Reviews:

---'i tried keyboard phones at verizon and this was my favorite.' **** 'favorite'

Negative Reviews:

---'this is the 4th android phone i have used (started on the eris, which was awful, awful, awful, and verizon upgraded me to the droid 2, droid 2 global, droid 3, and now the droid 4)  the droid 3 had a decent keyboard, but the buttons on the droid 4 are spaced and sized much better.although the phone is heavy, its weighted nice, and feels tough.' **** 'awful'

__________('people',)__________


Positive Reviews:

Positive Reviews:

---'without trying to sound like an apple hater, they did a good job on the iphone 4 with battery life, but otherwise i like getting a phone that uses a universal platform, charger from my other phones and devices, and for an elevated user the droids offer more models and customization, giving every customer their choice in a phone, rather than pushing one model every year or two for the whole population.' **** 'elevated'
---"personally, i'm not a heavy user so the 4g maybe a little lost on me (3g plenty fast), but all of the other upgrades are so worth it." **** 'heavy'

---'while i have read reports of poor battery life, i can attest that with lte (which is astonishingly fast), push email on two accounts, and lots of texting and emailing throughout the day, i have no problem at all making it through a full day with about 40% remaining.the tradeoff to the wonderful keyboard is that the phone is rather bulky.' **** 'poor'

---'the only negative is the battery life, however it charges fairly quickly; i have a charger in my car, office and at home.' **** 'negative'
---'the droid 4 is almost perfect.its incredibly fast, very easy to use, has decent battery life for a smart phone, and the layout of the keyboard is awesome.it even lets you make a phone call!but i say "almost" because there is a huge design flaw with this phone.the back light illumination for the keyboard has all kinds of issues.the lighting will randomly shut off in the dark after a couple seconds and wont turn back on unless you slide the phone closed.even in the middle of a typing it will just go off for no reason, with no change in light level.sometimes it does not even turn on at all, even in complete darkness.' **** 'easy'
---"if a replaceable battery, the best screen, the smallest size, or even the fastest processor is more important than a keyboard, this isn't the phone for you." **** 'replaceable'
---"by the way, they make mobile power packs you can use to charge your battery anywhere so replaceable battery is not the most important thing to me but it would be better if it had it.the other cons is it doesn't run android 4, or ics (ice cream sandwich) but motorola said it will be updated in the next 6 months." **** 'replaceable'
