---'the new windows phone has instagram, vine, waze, snapchat, google maps and most of the other secondary apps people love.' **** 'new'
---"this is what bothers me about some of the negative reviews here, they are negative about customer service or because they were less than thrilled with windows phone os, but that is not a review of the lumia 1520. so i am going to make the assumption that whoever is buying this phone has done a bit of research (i know, a rather large assumption but i'll fly with it for now), and actually wants a windows phone." **** 'less'

Negative Reviews:

---'i was blown away by how many selections they had for some genres.- love the fact that i can individually access my voicemails by clicking on them instead of having to log into voicemail and wait through the digital announcer.- very happy to be able to access my files on this phone through a regular windows explorer window.things that are so-so:- there seems to be a small issue w/touch sensitivity that some people are experiencing, but that may be fixable through software.- phone calls are fine.' **** 'regular'
---"if you are driving, even pick up the call will be a problem with one hand(i know, i know, don't drive and .....)3. i still wish i can have those missed apps i had on android, comparing those app i installed on galaxy note (about 20 of them), i found all my apps in windows phone app store except 3 are not available.btw, anyone want to jump to windows phone, you can check here for available windows phone apps: [...] then you can decide if some critical apps are missing when you switch the ship." **** 'available'
