Positive Reviews:

---"here comes the release and bb10 doesn't disappoint.the size, weight and tactile feel of the blackberry z10 is a win for blackberry's designers and in an era where every smartphone vendor seems to be going towards bigger and bigger screens in an attempt to provide differentiation, the z10 is perfect for single-handed use.the z10 seemed to me to offer up crisper images than the other s3 and iphone 5. maybe that is because the z10 tops the other two at 356 pixels per inch (ppi), compared to 306 ppi for the galaxy s iii and 326 ppi for the iphone 5.z10 has an 8-megapixel rear camera; however, the z10 boasts a 2-megapixel front-facing camera , while the iphone 5's camera is rated at 1.2 megapixels and the galaxy s iii's at 1.9 megapixels." **** 'single-handed'

---")in is: gesturing to your contact folder and scrolling down through all of your contacts or scrolling to your favorites (limited to 10) and scrolling through those and pressing on their name to call them.unlike pressing a single key to make a call (as with your voice mail) neither of those options is something that you can do safely while driving.phone calls:out is disconnecting on a call or dismissing a call while in any screen.in is gesturing back to the calling screen to disconnect or dismiss.search:out is universal search from the home page.if none of the above bothers you, but you are a person who only likes to type on a hard key pad, then you should wait for the q10.unfortunately, if the use of blackberry's legacy features (as mentioned above) are more important to you for running your day to day business, than cropping photos and making videos, then neither phone will work for you at this time.and forget about visiting the blackberry forums or any other support group to get answers, you'll only be treated like an idiot and flamed by the bb employees that run them or post in them." **** 'other'
