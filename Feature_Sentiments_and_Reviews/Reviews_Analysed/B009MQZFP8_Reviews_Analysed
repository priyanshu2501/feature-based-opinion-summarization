Negative Reviews:

---"i absolutely love the design and like it better than my sister's galaxy s3 as it makes the phone feel sturdier in the hand and can be used one-handed, button placement is a bit unusual but you quickly get the hang of it.so far, the only drawback has been battery life as i'm getting something around 24h on a charge with wifi on constantly, 30 mins of music playback and 3h of browsing." **** 'battery'
---'( but you have to accept that even the average smarthphones are not able to match to a camera in this respect) .- the battery life is acceptable in my case , since i use it to browse and chat moderately ( also use another phone to my work) .' **** 'acceptable'
---"it was laggy, phone calls wouldn't go through, battery life didn't last more then 8 hours without having to recharge, and overall i was very frustrated." **** 'last'
