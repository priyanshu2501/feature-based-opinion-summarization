---'It is beyond amazing.. the experience you get from this phone is mind blowing.. i was kind of disturbed by the placement of the buttons but since im left handed its convenient.. only other thng  really dont care for is the lack of withstanding battery life.. the whole point of buying this phone is to cut some time from work and since its a smartphone, more battery life is needed.. Other than that, this is a Marvelous phone i would advice anyone to get it.' **** 'battery'
