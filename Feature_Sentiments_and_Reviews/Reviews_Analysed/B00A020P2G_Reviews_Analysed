__________('sim', 'card')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"So having said that, Pros:- Good size, light, and attractive- Screen is very responsive and almost too sensitive sometimes, easy to scroll and web-browse- Easy to use- Runs android- Can use two SIM cards (you do have to choose which card is active, but since I'm only using one SIM its not a problem)- It DOES work in the US (and with T-mobile) (Some people were saying it wouldn't accept T-mobile carrier and that it wouldn't work in the States; seems to be working fine)- It is unlocked- It was $160, which meant that this phone + case + screen protector + micro SD card is still cheaper than most unlocked phones.- Good camera- It was NEW- Long battery life, especially with the power saving option- The first thing the phone does is ask you what language you prefer and ENGLISH is one of those as well as many other languages (I saw a lot of complaints about it being in a foreign language)- Good phone quality, can hear everything clearlyCons:- The phone has very little memory (2GB only) so if you want to download a lot of apps, the phone will become super slow, however, you can use a micro SD card to increase memory and store photos/videos.- It is not the fastest processor, if you are switching quickly through multiple apps or web pages, it does take a second or two to load." **** 'cheaper'
