---"another thing i like is the battery is replaceable so if your having battery problems just buy a new one also the back piece doesn't come off easily unlike the iphone 5 my friend dropped his phone once and now the back piece comes off easily i have yet to drop this phone and hopefully i don't." **** 'replaceable'
