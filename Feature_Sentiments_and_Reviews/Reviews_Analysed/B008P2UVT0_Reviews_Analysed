---"Was looking for a phone with a pull out keyboard I just don't like the touch screen for texting and this phone was such a deal everything is so simple from ringtones to photos nice phone" **** 'touch'
---"PROS:- slide-out keyboard is nice if you aren't the best with touch screens or texting- access to googleplay- you can use the swype keyboard- it's a nice size, it fits well in your hand- seems sturdy, doesnt feel like it'll just break if you drop it- the cost is relatively low compared to other smartphonesCONS:- at first it doesn't lag much but eventually it lags a lot, sometimes taking several minutes to load web pages- received text messages started recently to be delayed, anywhere from 2 minutes to 2 hours late, likely a problem with virgin mobile and not the phone- call quality isn't so good, sounds almost like the other person is under water- i counted the number of seconds it took to start up, and it took 96 seconds." **** 'nice'
---'I think this means that Virgin Mobile is bound to disappear... Fortunately, this phone comes with the Swype touch keyboard installed, because the touchscreen is often ridiculously unresponsive and the keyboard requires very precise finger-position and finger-pressure to use.' **** 'unresponsive'
