---"he said the camera is just so so, but otherwise he's happy with it." **** 'happy'
---"the wifi can be a bit flakey switching it on and off, but i've noticed this tends to be an android issue on most units i've used.two minor cons: the display is pretty low res (320x240) and the camera is bad." **** 'bad'
---'the camera could be better but everthing else on the phone with the adroid 4.0 works great.' **** 'better'
---'some general comments about this phone:the camera is weak in terms of color balance and the video could be clearer but they work adequately.i put in a 16gb card and for my uses this is fine.the volume is now working well.as others have mentioned the top level of the keyboard is too close to the screen.i do not like the fact that the fn functions needs to be activated each time that a number needs to be added.i do not like the fact that the essentials program needs to be added.' **** 'weak'

---'use the built-in wifi when you can.the camera is awful.' **** 'awful'
---'(a photography expert once told me, that for most people, 3.3 megapixels is all you need for pictures as big as 8.5"x11 - and so you should shop for other performance measures when looking for a low end camera - so from my perspective 3.2 megapixels is as good as you need in any camera for a smart phone, the other features being more important).compared to other devices in its price segment the rise has: a faster cpu, bigger screen, better keyboard, a flash for the 3.2 mega pixel camera (which other devices don\'t have).what it lacks is a second camera facing you for video calling - something that still isn\'t used that much, and i only used once or twice on my ipod just to prove that it worked - so i don\'t miss that on this device.i\'ve used the navigation tool and it works amazingly well.' **** 'second'

---"while it may not seem like that big of a deal, if you really need to call someone or send a text it's irritating- sometimes typing lags, especially if you've gone a while without turning it off completely and restarting- very little internal storage for apps or even messages, adds to the lag of the phone- the default camera has a sound it makes when you take a picture that you can't turn off, so you basically have to just get a new camera app- the quality of the speakers on the phone isn't very high- the camera quality isn't very good, with things closer up it's especially blurry- there isn't a front-facing cameraso would i recommend it?" **** 'new'
