__________('speaker',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the reception is crystal clear, i get 3-4 bars everywhere i go, and not a single dropped call yet.many reviewers complain about the low speaker volume, and i solved that problem (as other reviewers suggested) by experimenting with the position of the speaker against my ear.' **** 'low'

Negative Reviews:

---'but personally i felt that the volume was a little low on the speaker when in the car, but it does the trick perfectly if you are just sitting at home.the fm radio is a welcome addition, even though an mp3 player would be way more desireable.' **** 'low'

__________('time',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'if you are somewhere deep into the menus of the phone, you must remember to push a button to clear the screen before you close the phone, otherwise when you open the phone hours later, it is still on the same detailed screen you were on last time as opposed to the main screen (like i said, some people may like this feature... i hate it).because these quirks are minor and probably personal, i do recommend this phone to others.' **** 'last'
