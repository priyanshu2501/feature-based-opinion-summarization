---"at first glance the nokia n85 seems to have it all: gps, good camera, 3g features, etc etc etc.after owning one of these for over 2 months now i believe it's safe to say it's one of the best disguised useless gadgets i've ever seen, and here's why:1. after buying it, i spent countless hours searching, installing and configuring stuff that should be in the phone already, like a simple chronometer/timer;2. things don't work as expected a lot of the time, enough to draw attention to the phone itself." **** 'safe'
