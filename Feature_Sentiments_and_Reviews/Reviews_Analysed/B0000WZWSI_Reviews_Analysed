---")- good battery life (but i also recommend getting a car charger if you're on the road a lot)- speed dialing- improved itap predictive text feature for easy text entry- sort phonebooks entries, ringtones, pictures and wallpapers into distinct categories- ringer id (different rings for different people/groups)- switching ring styles (loud, vibrate, silent, etc) without having to open phone- useful, uniquely blue outer display- view minutes and text usage online with t-mobile- with data cable: free wallpaper, ringtone, and games transfer- with data cable: free pictures download from phone to pcfeatures neutral to me, but still cool to have:- better-than-average vga-level camera- picture id (assign a picture to display when a certain friend calls)- useful calendar with month-view and week-view- easy to use calculator- aol instant messenger client built-in (uses text messages)- voice dialing- voice memo- tri-band world phone- potentially free html browsing with webviewer software from reqwireless (since t-mobile gives you free basic wap service), or some other third-party html browserfeatures i didn't like, or wish it had:- sometimes phone seems a little slow, but this is just minor nip-picking- wish it had bluetooth or infrared- better phonebook search system (can only search by first letter of name)- wish it had an integrated flash for the camera- antenna stub (i prefer internal antennas)arguable features, depending on personal preference:- color of the phone- size of the phone (3.50&quot; x 1.93&quot; x 0.98&quot; / 89mm x 49mm x 25mm)- weight of the phone (4.30 oz / 122g)- unique alternating keypad button shapes- built-in ringtones (not bad, but could be better in my opinion)- menu system (i think it's great, but some don't)as you can see, as far as my usage is concerned, this phone is pretty much perfect, deserving its full five stars.next, since you'll probably be purchasing this phone with t-mobile's service, let me tell you about t-mobile." **** 'easy'

---'when i bought this phone 11 months ago it was one of the most advanced phones i had ever had, so my excitement helped me to ignore little bugs such as the cover screen freezing up (i frequently have to cut my phone on and off to make it work), the camera\'s sometimes grainy quality (i have one crystal clear picture), and the way i would miss a few calls due to my ringer switching from "vibe and ring" to "silent" in my pocket or purse.' **** 'due'
