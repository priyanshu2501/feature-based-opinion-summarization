---'The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.' **** 'dropped'
---'The calls are clear.' **** 'clear'
---"And because you can't turn on the speakerphone until the call is connected, it was very difficult to make calls, since the earpiece volume was so low, I often couldn't hear the other person answer (or I could tell that they had answered, but not have been able to hear what they said.)" **** 'difficult'
---'The cost of the calls was pretty reasonable too, the best among all the cell phone carriers.' **** 'reasonable'
---'When I bought this phone 11 months ago it was one of the most advanced phones I had ever had, so my excitement helped me to ignore little bugs such as the cover screen freezing up (I frequently have to cut my phone on and off to make it work), the camera\'s sometimes grainy quality (I have ONE crystal clear picture), and the way I would miss a few calls due to my ringer switching from "vibe and ring" to "silent" in my pocket or purse.' **** 'due'
---'Ever since I switched to T-Moble the calls have been very clear, even with only 1 or 2 bars of signal strength!' **** 'clear'
---'I just got this phone yesterday, to replace my lg 5250 with sprint service (often problems with dropped calls, messages & voicemails coming 1-2 days late, customer service of not much help, etc..).' **** 'dropped'
---"As I'm sure most of you have read in some other reviews, we also have had a problem with dropped calls that we didn't have a problem with a few months ago." **** 'dropped'
---'The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.' **** 'dropped'
---"It has a spring-locking mechanism that makes connecting the charger foolproof--but if you just yank it out without pressing the button, I can see how you might break it so that it wouldn't connect well later--but on the other hand, if you throw it down on the driveway then run over it with your car, it might drop calls and start sounding poor then also." **** 'poor'
