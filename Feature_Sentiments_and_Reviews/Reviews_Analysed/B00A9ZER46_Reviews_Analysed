__________('processor',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"for this price, i don't think you can find a phone with the same benefits (for hardware and aesthetics).even thou i found out that it heats a lot while using some apps; what doesn't changes my opinion about the general aspects of the phone.bright, clear and tough screen, heavy processor and about enough space (if you don't expect to have an ipod as a phone) to have all your stuff inside.while i do have some problems with signal here in chile, most likely because of my carrier, when connected with 3g i can make use of most of the apps without problems.most recommended!" **** 'heavy'

---'if you use external speakers, sounds perfect.- if you are planning to load the device with music, maybe the 16gb (about $30 more) version will suit best your needs.- camera is great for daylight pictures, but not so great for night pictures, but this is a common problem with mobile cameras.' **** 'music'

__________('call',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'as soon as i made my first call the problems arised.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'this is more of an issue with the third party android app than the phone itself.has a decent radio but like all smart phones has a tendency to want to lock on to 4g coverage even when its not even possible to make a call, necessitating you to manually put it in 2g only mode when in a rural area without 4g so you can make a call...beware i told you so.it has shown no issues of blue tooth syncing like some have experienced, it sinks automatically in my company ford f150 pretty much every time, if not, i simply push the sync button on the steering wheel and say "phone"...it connects and i am on my way.when you start filling it up with apps, there ends up being a lot of apps that think they need access to your gps location services but don\'t.' **** 'possible'

__________('google', 'nexus')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i finally broke down after my third replacement, after nearly two years of uneventful use, crapped out in just a couple of weeks, and ordered a brand spanking new nexus 4 from the google play store.' **** 'new'
---"they recommended contacting google 1-855-83-nexus (63987) since they asked lg not to provide assistance on under warranty nexus devices.i contacted google nexus and they told me: if you didn't purchase your device or accessory on google play, contact the retailer where you purchased your device or accessory." **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---"with google music (which allows you to upload unlimited music to google so you can access it anywhere), drop box, and other cloud storage services, it's not too hard to find ways to handle your data, even if you do use up your 8gb of space.the screen on the nexus 4 is probably the best there is right now." **** 'best'
---'finally, saturday @ 4 a.m. i got an email from google, my nexus 4 had finally shipped from google.' **** 'google'
---'i should also note that i am, or at least was, a very happy nexus 7 owner until my difficulties with the 4 have changed my opinion on the nexus products and google themselves.' **** 'happy'

---'"feels" more solidgoogle wallet is fully supported.batter life is well over double what the battery life of the galaxy nexus is on 4g lte.brings us to the disadvantages:batter is not user replaceable.personally, i think the galaxy nexus with it\'s amoled display has a slight advantage in contrast and color saturation.over-all, i\'m very happy with the nexus 4 and can highly recommend it.' **** 'happy'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'you will need to recharge the phone by afternoon.- despite the promise of no bloatware, there are some google apps that run on the phone that you cannot kill or choose to stop.' **** 'google'
---'no expandable memory: if you buy the cheapest nexus 4, it costs $299, and comes with 8gb of onboard memory, of which only about 6.5gb is available for your apps and storage.' **** 'available'
---"other than that, most of the apps doesn't need to go completely to the edges in order to swap.hardware: this phone is absolutely fast, no lag at all doing any tasks.- screen is very responsive and for our use (mainly work tasks) the 8gb version is more than sufficient (we are packed with sync apps like evernote, pocket and drive, and docs of all sorts, and still have 3gb free).- colors and screen brightness are pretty good." **** 'other'
---'works great with my apps and i was able to transfer all my contacts using my google account.' **** 'able'

Negative Reviews:

---"i don't consider it hot, but you will notice it.#3 i can't get around this text message warning windows, i have tried other sms apps and still receive this stupid error." **** 'receive'

---'again i am running cm with menu button on my virtual bar, but most of the time i have expanded desktop with lmt launcher(which is just pie control in app form) on... that allows me to have other apps in short cut when i bring it up.speaking of virtual navigation... it does take up considerable amount of screen like i said above, most roms will give your ability to get rid of it or make it smaller.' **** 'other'
---"the screen quality is excellent, the speed of apps is good, but i can't seem to get more than a third of a day of battery lifetime on this phone." **** 'good'
