---"Well, if you want to pay an extra $60 on the extended battery pack, you MIGHT just be able to make it through a full day's use.... unless you want to make phone calls or do anything else on the phone, in which case you better keep a charger with you at all times." **** 'extra'

---'Stock battery was dead after about 1 hr of listening to music.... pathetic.- Answering calls becomes a fun game of furiously tapping the "answer" button until it recognizes that you might want to actually use the phone for more than just a paperweight.- Texting is a blast thanks to the keyboard that randomly decides it\'s tired now and would like to disappear for a bit.' **** 'dead'
