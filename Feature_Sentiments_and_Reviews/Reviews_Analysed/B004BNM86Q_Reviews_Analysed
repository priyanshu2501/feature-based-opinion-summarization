Positive Reviews:

---'this is her first touch screen phone (i had the same one for almost 2 yrs from amazon, used and still works fine).' **** 'touch'
---'i liked the multiple types of video and photo effect that it offers.-built-in hotspot feature (requires data plan) that turns your phone into a wireless internet router.-responsive touch screen and crisp 3.8" lcd display.-multiple options for hands-free voice control-internet surfing was smooth with its large screen-texting was easier than other touch screen phones due its larger virtual keyboard size (compared to the iphone) and offers swype-built-in / integrated gps (i realized that you could run gps apps like "navigon" on the phone without needing a constant internet connection-- unlike others smart phones)cons:-the phone feels bulky/heavy compared to other smart phones out there in the market.-the camera quality of the front facing camera was pretty "choppy" unlike the built in 5mp camera on the back.' **** 'easier'
---'even though the phone is touch screen, it provides push buttons that let you go: home, back to previous, menu options and easy touch guide.' **** 'touch'
