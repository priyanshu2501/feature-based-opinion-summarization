__________('data', 'plan')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"this phone is perfect if:1. you really don't see the need for a separate tablet device with a separate data plan2." **** 'separate'
---'i have at&t; data that i buy each month as i have the go-phone (pre-paid plan) and i buy the smallest data they have as i use wifi 95% of the time.6) wifi easy to connect and works perfectly with long range ability!7) good stock browser, however, i downloaded dolphin hd browser and i can get "desktop" pages (not mobile pages) and also tabs, and so so many features.' **** 'smallest'
---'if you have a regular data plan with att, (not a prepaid plan) you will have no problems connecting the gn.i have an unlimited data plan for 4g phones, however, you will have to change your apn settings (the info is on one of the comments posted on amazon).' **** 'regular'

Negative Reviews:

---'your imei range was not impacted and your product will work without issue and without concern of losing your unlimited smartphone data plan experience.to be clear, you have not actually received any "alerts" from at&t; about data plan eligibility because you have not moved your sim card into the samsung galaxy note product as of yet?' **** 'clear'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"root attempts: 1 (success first try) i loved this phone when i first got it but now that i own a note 2 the note 1 seems a little slow to load apps after having a few aftermarket background processes like yahoo mail, auto sms, multiple game auto update's etc.pros:-replaces a camera, phone, tablet, and most desktop pc programs." **** 'slow'
---'as to be expected, movies will drain your battery faster.- apps are more functional and a lot of fun to use.- a dream come true for frequent travelers as it will definitely reduce the number of devices you carry on trips.' **** 'functional'
---'the things that interetsed me about it was first its size a 5.3" screen the biggest in the industry the fact that it had a 2500 watt battery also was a selling point... but the useful information that i could get ended there, here\'s what a number of people let out.lets look at what wasn\'t said; the processor a dual core 1.5 ghz makes using this phone a dream its fast on the scrolling and gets apps open and used quickly (downloading speed of apps depends on your service).' **** 'open'
---'i was able to keep all my apps, bookmarks in dolphin browser, contacts, etc.' **** 'able'
---'i basically still have to charge this unit daily.app store: google app store has all the popular apps that are available for ios.roaming: i was able to roam (voice and data) without any problems in japan (but without the benefit of 4g/lte speeds.' **** 'popular'

Negative Reviews:

---"this phone came from germany and so i didn't have to suffer from at&t; messing with the phone or the native apps." **** 'native'
---"kies air - samsung's excellent tool that allows you to transfer anything on to your phone form any laptop over the air (without the need for any cables).5. the visidon application (free) - this app uses your fornt camera to allow you to selectively lock certain apps using face recognition." **** 'certain'
---"so this time i've decided to go for another brand, and hopefully samsung will not disappoint me.the quality of the screen is amazing and all the apps runs really fast due it's 1.4 dual core processor." **** 'due'
---"downloaded music apps (which are a nice choice to have - let's not lose sight of that) were generally subpar for one reason or another as well." **** 'music'
---"combined w/ the vast app, music & movie selections in our personal media collections, 3'rd party apps off the web (i haven't d-loaded any yet btw) then there's the sick amount of media & apps at the google play store and great utility apps for specific phones in the samsung apps library the possibilties are incredible." **** 'library'

Positive Reviews:

---'kindle reading in bed when all lights are off and partner wants to sleep.samsung has released the source code and driver info so there is already a lot of support in the community in best linux/android fashion.this device here on amazon.com is actually the same that is sold in germany (this vendor ships batches to the us and replenishes the stock as needed, that\'s why there is sometimes an odd statement like "will ship in 2 days when available" next to the purchase button).' **** 'available'
