Positive Reviews:

---'only have 1 hiccup on occasion, it sometimes says 911 calls only.it seems to happen if i do not use the phone for more than 3 days.it is a prepaid phone and i use the $2.00 a day option(unlimited calls and texts only,per day)(out of 3 options) and i have credit on it to make calls so i have to reset the phone(sometimes taking the battery out of it)..only 1 time i had to do it 3x then no issues so far..if you drop below a $10.00 balance, you will get a message that says to refill your phone, and what your balance is ..it will happen every time you try to make a call or listen to voice mail..so you have to go through the prompts to exit the message.. then it will make the call..i have very good credit but did not care anymore to spend $79.00 a month plus taxes and fees (w/ an occasional late charge averaging $90.00 a month)in a 2 yr.contract plan..so far i have not spent more than $30 a month and i have magic jack at home, most calls can wait till i get home..i so far have spent as little as $12.00 a month and i love it..i can get internet on my phone but it costs a little more for service..so,the internet can wait till i get home also..overall knowing the maximum i will spend is $60.00 a month with taxes and fees included, no more late charges it makes it well worth it..i used to be a sprint customer, but the reception is bad in my area, and the sprint airrave only worked at home,slowed my internet connection down, raised my electric bill(it also generates a lot of heat),if you are out of contract with sprint, as i was, customer service gives you the runaround and tells you you need a new phone and that is what i did, lol with at&t.' **** 'little'

Positive Reviews:

---"well, when i was reading the reviews about this phone i almost didn't buy it because the negative points were quite effective in stating that it wasn't quite as good as it seemed, still i bought it because the price for a touch screen phone is very appealing, so i decided to give it a try.i have this phone for 3 weeks now, and i can tell that i don't regret having bought at all, there is the issue with the screen lock, it is annoying in the beginning, but then again, i am glad it is there because it prevents me from accessing something i didn't want to by accident while it is in my pocket or something, though when i am in call and i need to use the dial pad, sometimes it takes me a while to push the little unlock button on the side, and sometimes i miss the number(s) i need to push and i have to terminate the call and call again and re-start, but still i can live with it.the phone itself is awesome, the features, the tools, the navigation (phone and web) is really good, i have to say it is worth buying it, and it even feels like a steal paying only $79.99, i am even thinking about buying one for wife as well.the only thing that is not resolved for me is the fact that it is locked, and since i travel a lot i need to have local numbers for these places, so i need an unlocked phone, for now i still have my old phone but i want to get rid of it, so i looked up in the web about unlocking it, and for my surprise i have seen quite a few comments that you can unlock it for free by just calling at&t; and requesting the unlock code, since i am traveling right now, i haven't had a chance to call the customer service number of at&t; to check if it is true, if it is, then maybe i will buy maybe two more(might even give one to my daughter)." **** 'little'

---"well, when i was reading the reviews about this phone i almost didn't buy it because the negative points were quite effective in stating that it wasn't quite as good as it seemed, still i bought it because the price for a touch screen phone is very appealing, so i decided to give it a try.i have this phone for 3 weeks now, and i can tell that i don't regret having bought at all, there is the issue with the screen lock, it is annoying in the beginning, but then again, i am glad it is there because it prevents me from accessing something i didn't want to by accident while it is in my pocket or something, though when i am in call and i need to use the dial pad, sometimes it takes me a while to push the little unlock button on the side, and sometimes i miss the number(s) i need to push and i have to terminate the call and call again and re-start, but still i can live with it.the phone itself is awesome, the features, the tools, the navigation (phone and web) is really good, i have to say it is worth buying it, and it even feels like a steal paying only $79.99, i am even thinking about buying one for wife as well.the only thing that is not resolved for me is the fact that it is locked, and since i travel a lot i need to have local numbers for these places, so i need an unlocked phone, for now i still have my old phone but i want to get rid of it, so i looked up in the web about unlocking it, and for my surprise i have seen quite a few comments that you can unlock it for free by just calling at&t; and requesting the unlock code, since i am traveling right now, i haven't had a chance to call the customer service number of at&t; to check if it is true, if it is, then maybe i will buy maybe two more(might even give one to my daughter)." **** 'touch'

Negative Reviews:

---"well, when i was reading the reviews about this phone i almost didn't buy it because the negative points were quite effective in stating that it wasn't quite as good as it seemed, still i bought it because the price for a touch screen phone is very appealing, so i decided to give it a try.i have this phone for 3 weeks now, and i can tell that i don't regret having bought at all, there is the issue with the screen lock, it is annoying in the beginning, but then again, i am glad it is there because it prevents me from accessing something i didn't want to by accident while it is in my pocket or something, though when i am in call and i need to use the dial pad, sometimes it takes me a while to push the little unlock button on the side, and sometimes i miss the number(s) i need to push and i have to terminate the call and call again and re-start, but still i can live with it.the phone itself is awesome, the features, the tools, the navigation (phone and web) is really good, i have to say it is worth buying it, and it even feels like a steal paying only $79.99, i am even thinking about buying one for wife as well.the only thing that is not resolved for me is the fact that it is locked, and since i travel a lot i need to have local numbers for these places, so i need an unlocked phone, for now i still have my old phone but i want to get rid of it, so i looked up in the web about unlocking it, and for my surprise i have seen quite a few comments that you can unlock it for free by just calling at&t; and requesting the unlock code, since i am traveling right now, i haven't had a chance to call the customer service number of at&t; to check if it is true, if it is, then maybe i will buy maybe two more(might even give one to my daughter)." **** 'touch'

Negative Reviews:

---"well, when i was reading the reviews about this phone i almost didn't buy it because the negative points were quite effective in stating that it wasn't quite as good as it seemed, still i bought it because the price for a touch screen phone is very appealing, so i decided to give it a try.i have this phone for 3 weeks now, and i can tell that i don't regret having bought at all, there is the issue with the screen lock, it is annoying in the beginning, but then again, i am glad it is there because it prevents me from accessing something i didn't want to by accident while it is in my pocket or something, though when i am in call and i need to use the dial pad, sometimes it takes me a while to push the little unlock button on the side, and sometimes i miss the number(s) i need to push and i have to terminate the call and call again and re-start, but still i can live with it.the phone itself is awesome, the features, the tools, the navigation (phone and web) is really good, i have to say it is worth buying it, and it even feels like a steal paying only $79.99, i am even thinking about buying one for wife as well.the only thing that is not resolved for me is the fact that it is locked, and since i travel a lot i need to have local numbers for these places, so i need an unlocked phone, for now i still have my old phone but i want to get rid of it, so i looked up in the web about unlocking it, and for my surprise i have seen quite a few comments that you can unlock it for free by just calling at&t; and requesting the unlock code, since i am traveling right now, i haven't had a chance to call the customer service number of at&t; to check if it is true, if it is, then maybe i will buy maybe two more(might even give one to my daughter)." **** 'touch'

Negative Reviews:

---"well, when i was reading the reviews about this phone i almost didn't buy it because the negative points were quite effective in stating that it wasn't quite as good as it seemed, still i bought it because the price for a touch screen phone is very appealing, so i decided to give it a try.i have this phone for 3 weeks now, and i can tell that i don't regret having bought at all, there is the issue with the screen lock, it is annoying in the beginning, but then again, i am glad it is there because it prevents me from accessing something i didn't want to by accident while it is in my pocket or something, though when i am in call and i need to use the dial pad, sometimes it takes me a while to push the little unlock button on the side, and sometimes i miss the number(s) i need to push and i have to terminate the call and call again and re-start, but still i can live with it.the phone itself is awesome, the features, the tools, the navigation (phone and web) is really good, i have to say it is worth buying it, and it even feels like a steal paying only $79.99, i am even thinking about buying one for wife as well.the only thing that is not resolved for me is the fact that it is locked, and since i travel a lot i need to have local numbers for these places, so i need an unlocked phone, for now i still have my old phone but i want to get rid of it, so i looked up in the web about unlocking it, and for my surprise i have seen quite a few comments that you can unlock it for free by just calling at&t; and requesting the unlock code, since i am traveling right now, i haven't had a chance to call the customer service number of at&t; to check if it is true, if it is, then maybe i will buy maybe two more(might even give one to my daughter)." **** 'touch'

---"and when sending it, doesn't always send because its a touch screen and it being not accurate with think you didn't touch the send buttoncalling- finecamera- nothing special, it doesn't zoom, so that can be a pain sometimesbattery life- some weeks it will last 2-3 days before i need to charge it again, but others is less then a day, also if you have one bar left and turn it off then back on it will die almost instantly, that is one of my least favorite thingsalso, the back of the phone comes off all the time." **** 'touch'
---'its not the best touch screen i have ever used, but it has its moments.' **** 'best'
---"i've owned no-frills gophones, and the truth is that those little hand sets stand head and shoulders above the lg in terms of both usability and value.here's what you'll get when you go with the lg gophone:- your phone will make mystery calls for no apparent reason- it will lock the screen just when you need to press an on-screen prompt- it will open applications without being prompted- your open applications will be scrolled out of view and hard to find when you need them- it will hang up calls before you can answer them- it will not pick up calls you intend to answer- the battery will go dead early and often- it will not keep the screen locked when you need it tothe problem is, the lg's touch screen implementation is really a shoddy piece of work.bottom line, i wouldn't sell this device to my worst enemy." **** 'touch'
---'the newer touch screen phones work off of heat from you touch rather then actually having to add pressure to the lcd screen.do not waste your money on this phone!!' **** 'newer'
---"i will load full pages but i mostly go to mobile versions of my favorite sites(tomshardware, facebook, wikipedia).camera: 2mp takes decent shots and the camcorder is nice to have in a pinch.touchscreen: the screen is resistive but is responsive and doesn't require a lot of pressure and the menus scroll and navigate pretty fast, there is some lag when loading the music player but i have noticed this get longer with the more songs i have on my memory card.cons:data/internet: this could be a deal killer for some people." **** 'responsive'
---'little did i know i was happy i had a touch screen but shocked and dissappointed when i learned it is only 2g....... and since i use the internet alot to listen to music this was heartbreaking to me when i couldnt download things that even my old ugly worn out pantech intrigue could.' **** 'touch'

---"also sometimes the t9 mode button will indicate it's on but it isn't and you have to hit the button a second time for it to actually work.screen problems: the touch screen shifts sideways so that if you hit a 3 you get a 1 and makes the phone unusable." **** 'touch'
---"we're talking about $.10 now and then, but it's still adds some distrust about at&t;'s billing practices.i'm hoping with the cheaper smartphone hardware coming out that prepaid smartphones will be in the horizon this year, but overall lg prime works well and is the best touchscreen prepaid phone i've come across so far." **** 'distrust'
