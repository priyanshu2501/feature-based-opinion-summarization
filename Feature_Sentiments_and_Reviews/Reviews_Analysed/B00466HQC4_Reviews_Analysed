Negative Reviews:

---"you will also need a google email account (if you already one, you can use that, if not, it's free to sign up).the only drawback with this phone (probably for all smart phones), is that it will use a lot of data but t-mobile has good data programs that are affordable.overall, this phone is an excellent value for the price." **** 'good'

---"i then have to uninstall the update, but i can't remove the app and can't stop it from updating so before long it updates itself again.without being able to use any apps i want to use, the phone is little different from a dumbphome, and when that one app updates even grooveip won't work." **** 'able'

---"i ended up returning this phone and getting an unlocked nokia e5, which i'm happy with (no touch screen, but at least it's responsive).like the other reviewer, though, in general i recommend value offered by t-mobile prepaid service for people who are not heavy cell phone users." **** 'happy'
