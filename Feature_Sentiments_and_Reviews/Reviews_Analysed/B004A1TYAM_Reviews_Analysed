Negative Reviews:

---'first of all, this is my 3rd android phone, and my 2nd htc android phone.what i like:==========-the screen is really crisp-the touch feel is more responsive than my htc desire-screen size is just awesome if you do a lot of reading with your phone "emails, news"-the phone is surprisingly lighter than it seems, one may think "this must be heavy", well it is not-the phone is very slim, which gives it with the huge screen size some classy effect-nice htc widgets available, specially email and news widgets, can\'t live without these two-htc new sence feature like locating your phone, locking it .. etc, really nice, but i disabled them thinking this might affect battery life- rom space is just awesome, no need for app-to-sd to keep all ur market installed appz available.- better multitouch experience than the former htc desirewhat i hate:==========- the battery life .. are you kidding me?!' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'overall i am very happy with it:pros:- solid build quality and, unlike most other phones, its not a glossy fingerprint magnet!- large and beautiful screen with great color saturation- runs fast and is very responsive - i have not encountered any lag- wi-fi hotspot is easily set up so i can pull e-mail into my ip*d touch- replaceable battery in the event that the battery fails- image quality of camera runs circles around *phone 3gs and is better than ip4- sound quality is fabulous for music and great for calls- usb internet pass-through functionality to save 3g data charges- its a small thing but the live wallpapers are beautiful- setting up imap to pull in exchange e-mail is easy- otterbox makes a very nice case for itcons:- battery life is only so-so - a day and a half at best- poor design for sim card slot - the sim causes a (slight) unsightly gap on the bottom cover- removing and replacing the battery cover is tricky - mine has a tiny gap after it was replaced- limited storage (8-gb micro-sd) for the price - should have been 16-gb- android market is a mess to say it nicely - limited number of good gamescomplaints about the box and size are silly.' **** 'music'

Negative Reviews:

---'love the camera recorder as well, it records at hd 720p if im not wrong.if you are not an android user dont worry it has a very freindly startup setup and it will guide you through the configuration.the only con is the manuals of the internatiional phone, it comes in german so i didnt know how long the phone has to be charged the first time, and it turns to be just until the light turns green.othe con is the battery, it wont last as you expected but in my case i have it always on 3g because of the internet connection and im always online.great phone the money is worth it.' **** 'first'
