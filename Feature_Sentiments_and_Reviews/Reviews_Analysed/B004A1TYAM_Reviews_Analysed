__________('htc', 'desire')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'What i like:==========-the screen is really crisp-the touch feel is more responsive than my HTC desire-screen size is just awesome if you do a lot of reading with your phone "emails, news"-the phone is surprisingly lighter than it seems, one may think "this must be heavy", well it is not-the phone is very slim, which gives it with the huge screen size some CLASSY effect-nice htc widgets available, specially email and news widgets, can\'t live without these two-htc new sence feature like locating your phone, locking it .. etc, really nice, but i disabled them thinking this might affect battery life- rom space is just awesome, no need for app-to-sd to keep all ur market installed appz available.- better multitouch experience than the former htc desirewhat i hate:==========- the battery life .. are you kidding me?!' **** 'former'
