---"turning some of the settings off (like keypad sounds and the vibration level), and shortening the backlight helps to preserve the battery life; i use this phone every day, but only charge it once or twice a week, and i wait until it's down to one bar before fully charging it...with texting, 'sent' and 'draft' are accessible through the icons at the top of the screen - and can be locked/unlocked/deleted that way, or erased at the bottom of the screen after reading the text.the keyboard is a nice one, although it's a little bigger than my other phone, which i guess would be a good thing for most people." **** 'nice'
