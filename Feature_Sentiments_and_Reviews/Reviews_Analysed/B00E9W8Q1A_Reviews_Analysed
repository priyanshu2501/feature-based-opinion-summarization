S.])Think:We need mobile phones first to make calls/TALK, only secondly to make lame pictures or waste time on inane games, if a half-$Thousand dollar device fails to pick up a remote, ultra-weak signal as happens with iPhones (they\'re not good in RF/signal processing), why do I need it ?' **** 'much'

---'And it IS a better battery, like 3 times the life of the old phone.' **** 'better'
---'Having come from a long line of cell phones (starting with the Blackberry Storm, then Storm 2, then HTC Thunderbolt, and lastly Samsung Galaxy S3), I still had not found the perfect phone for me - every phone had some sort of trade off, whether it be sluggish performance, poor battery life, or just lousy user interfacing.' **** 'poor'
---'The battery life of that phone was an issue for me right from the start so I purchased a larger battery for it.' **** 'larger'
---'Best of all, its battery life is outstanding between its 3, 500mAh battery and power-saving routines.' **** 'best'
---'After the first charge I ran a lot of apps, streamed some videos, surfed the web for hours and at the end of the day I still had about 15% battery life left which is pretty good.' **** 'good'
---'So to sum up everything about why I think this is the best phone right now:  1) best battery life  2) very durable build (scratch proof, fingerprint proof, water resistant)  3) large display, but still fits in your pocket  4) hands free voice commands when the phone is out of reach  5) active display  6) built in wireless charging' **** 'best'

Positive Reviews:

---'The radios are great -- both 4G & wifi.- In my basement, where I\'ve struggled to pull a 3G signal on the Gnex, I maintained a 4G connection on the Maxx, which allowed me to download apps (initial phone setup) while watching an HD video on YouTube- On the main floor of the house, where my signal would flip between 3G and 4G on the Gnex, the Maxx operates decidedly in 4G territory- At work, one room in the office far removed from the wifi antenna would consistently go to zero bars (yet, frustratingly, not lose it completely and therefore would not switch over to the strong 4G signal), I now have at least one wifi bar accompanied by a usable flow of data- Overall, switching between wifi and 4G on the margins seems improved vs. what I had before, though even with "ignore weak wifi connections" checked, the Maxx at times seems indecisive about switching from one to the other.' **** 'ignore'
