Positive Reviews:

---'ditch carrying around a spare charger and/or portable battery.just get this phone.the battery truly lasts.bought this for my wife, who always filled her purse with spare power options.the screen is great at 720p.no, it is not 1080p like my 24" monitor or my 55" tv, but again this is only a 5" screen.color and looks are great.my phone is 1080p and comparing the two i can\'t see the difference.overall just a great phone.my wife for years was clamoring for an iphone and this time i agreed she could get one if she chose.when she was in the store and actually held and fiddled with both, the choice was easy for her.she has no complaints and just loves it.she often now picks it up to play with instead of her laptop or ipad.her older smaller lte phone she never did that when all three were available.going from her old 4" to a nice 5" phone made all the difference in usability.and the size is not an issue, even with average sized lady hands.so no need to be a basketball player to handle it.' **** 'spare'

Negative Reviews:

---"i looked into the battery usage with an app, one of the main power drains (about equal to the screen) is the android kernel itself, although i don't know which specific kernel tasks are draining things." **** 'main'

---'the screen is beautiful, and you can do anything from place a call to send an email without touching the phone.' **** 'beautiful'
---'the busy (and noisy) droid boot animation, followed by the default red home screen, put me off at first -- it all just feels very "angry" -- but as i\'m sure you\'re aware, that\'s all easily changeable with a good selection of included live and static wallpapers (a soothing blue relaxed the feel of the phone for me; i wonder if the default aggressive red tone -- vzw\'s droid branding -- turns off would be buyers at the in-store display).while looking for my next phone, i\'ve been really intrigued by the front-firing speaker on the htc one.' **** 'first'
---')- but in dark rooms, it\'s almost as though the screen can\'t dim enough (but just slightly so)- the active notifications appearing on the screen aren\'t ever-present -- the phone needs to be jostled / disturbed for the blank screen to briefly light up and display the current notifications, but the phone does not need to be flipped over to activate this (a light tapping of the face-up phone causes the active display to light up)- >> the capacitive buttons now dim during most video playback [as up 12.15.15 update] -- nice; they were originally full bright, which was distracting in a dark setting.- there\'s just the slightest amount of light leak from between the screen and capacitive buttons, over the back button -- but only noticeable in a dark room- the maxx pixels per inch (ppi) display density works out to 296 ppi across the 5" screen.' **** 'light'
