---'keyboard is very practical to use and the screen  is touch sensitive.' **** 'touch'
---"normal use, unplugging it at 7am, and using it all day long with bbm, whatsupp, facebook and little internet would die close to 11pm.other than that, the phone works good, takes acceptable pictures and has a very good touch screen, and a magnificent keybord (which is why i've chosen it)." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---'my older devices could last 24+ hours between charges.the screen seems less durable, possibly because it is a new touch screen.' **** 'less'
---'the phone is very versatil, touch screen and stuff like that, however it freezes at times, motly if you download new applications for the phone, i only use whatsapp and black berry messenger, i dont use any other useless application such as face book or tiwtter and the phone still freezes, and the battery drains out so fast so if you are planning to buy this black berry you should buy car charger or an extra battery' **** 'touch'
---'this review has nothing to do with the seller that people are complaining about, only the phone.pros:-fantastic design and finish, super thin!-fastest blackberry yet, everything is silky smooth-browser is much improved, utilizing multi-touch pinch to zoom-best keyboard of all time-touch screen makes navigating around the menus much faster-good camera quality, good enough to get details on documents-battery life is decent, will last a day-the best messaging device by far-fantastic call quality and speakerphone, loud ringercons:-not the best gmail integration, no shortcut for starring emails-os7 is still behind android and ios in terms of available apps, touch screen integration, and user friendliness-no free navigation app, most android, windows 7, and nokia phones have this.-app updates take long-web browser still not as good as android/wp7/ios.the biggest thing holding rim back is the software.' **** 'touch'
---"i didn't buy this phone from amazon's website.i bought this bold touch 9900 for my uncle in december 2012. he wanted touch screen, wi-fi capable, qwerty keypad, 5mp camera with flash(very important), blackberry." **** 'bold'

---"the darn thing was a t-mobile branded cellphone, meaning i'm stuck with edge in places where i don't have wifi coverage, and not to mention the signal reception on this thing is terrible... your signal ends up dropping everywhere you go with medium to low reception, you'll get familiar with the sos sign on the screen, if you know what i mean.now back on topic, the cellphone is pretty nice, i'm specially digging the fact that you can have a dual-experience (physical keyboard and touch screen)." **** 'touch'
---'the oldest models were a little too wide; another had keys too close together; and the two storms were difficult to type on one-handed while walking (offset with the use of dragon voice).the screen is beautiful and clear, but most news websites are difficult to read without using the zoom feature; and that means more touching to read side-to-side.' **** 'beautiful'
