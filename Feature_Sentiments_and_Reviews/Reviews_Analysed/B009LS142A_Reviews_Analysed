Positive Reviews:

---"i would really prefer to make it work and keep it.but for some reason, net10 was unable to transfer my old phone number from my old phone to this phone.and then when i went back to try to get it, they could not even change the phone's number to my area code.i have called them five times, but the phone number has never changed the way that it is supposed to.they don't seem to have the technical knowledge to handle difficult situations like this, and they have not answered an email when i tried to contact them that way.too bad, because the phone would be pretty cool if they knew how use it.this is a new update from june 10, 2013:i was thinking about buying a different phone or a new one of the same model (hoping it would work) when i realized that net10 wasn't even offering this model for my zip code from their website." **** 'unable'
