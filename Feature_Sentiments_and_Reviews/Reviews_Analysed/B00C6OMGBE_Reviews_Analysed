Positive Reviews:

---'It had far better data mobile (network)connection then this one!' **** 'better'

Negative Reviews:

---'Today most of the options are companies like Sprint, AT&T;, Verizon and T-mobile (The cheaper and no longer require two year contracts) that offer cellphones extremely inexpensive .... hahaha yeah inexpensive = A two year phone contract where you are going to pay 90+ a year in average for unlimited voice and messages (Which is needed less than data in todays standards) and a very limited plan for data.' **** 'less'
---'The big downer on this phone for me was the Sprint service: poor coverage and unacceptable data speeds (what they call "3G" offers about 1/10th the speed of 3G on AT&T; and T-Mobile).' **** 'unacceptable'
---'Also, I have Sprint thus where there is a poor data reception (a lot) then there is a power drain.' **** 'poor'

Positive Reviews:

---"2 update at this time in the US)-Blinkfeed can't be shut off, but you can change it from the default home screen-Rear facing camera is only 4 megapixels (even if it has great low light performance - it's still just a 4 mp photo)." **** 'low'
---'The low light performance is second to none, and really helps capture shots in any condition.' **** 'low'
---'Less noise and better low light performance instead of blow-up-able pictures?' **** 'better'

---"So the advantages of the One's camera: excellent image quality for the pixels that it has, phenomenal low light performance, rapid snapshots and fast storage." **** 'low'
---"HTC took a gamble using ultra pixel technology(allows more light into the sensor) and it pays off in regards to indoor pictures because you don't need much light to take a good picture unlike other camera phones." **** 'much'

---"If you like constant pop-ups urging you to do things like check blinkfeed, sign into blinkfeed, add social media to blinkfeed, etc etc being forced on you constantly, like while you are playing games or watching movies or dialing someone, then you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this phone." **** 'add'

Positive Reviews:

---'I believe Amazon is able to sell these for so cheap as they are either the first bad batch of phones or they were binned as low quality.' **** 'able'
---'I dont mind it now since it is beautiful in Black, but I am upset that no one from Amazon had a curtezy to notify me of the change they are making.' **** 'curtezy'

__________('pixels',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"With the lower price, I don't regret not getting the S4, even the camera being lower pixels I looooove the ability of this phone to capture low-light photos so well!" **** 'lower'
---"I've never seen dead pixels in any of the phones I've ever owned and also any monitors or TVs I have ever owned." **** 'dead'
---"The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light." **** 'light'
---'OK, great, bigger pixels mean more light per pixel, sure.' **** 'bigger'

Negative Reviews:

---'The only improvement I would recommend is the main camera pixels to be 9 or higher.' **** 'higher'
---"First of all the speaker is front facing, second of all you have stereo speakers.- The camera quality is good especially in low light given the fact that it has less pixels, they are simply bigger capturing more details in low light (check out dpreview comparisons of this phone and 3 others in terms of picture quality)- The sound is good but I would recommend using your own headphones, personally I hate Dr Dre's sound quality." **** 'less'
---'What REALLY got to me were dead pixels!!' **** 'dead'
---'I Urge everyone to check their screens for very bad viewing angles as well as dead pixels.' **** 'dead'
