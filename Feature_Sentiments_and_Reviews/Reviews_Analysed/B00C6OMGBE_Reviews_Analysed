Positive Reviews:

---'data performance is also very good.' **** 'good'
---'i can\'t believe this, but i may be contemplating the first really well made universal remote!the big downer on this phone for me was the sprint service: poor coverage and unacceptable data speeds (what they call "3g" offers about 1/10th the speed of 3g on at&t; and t-mobile).' **** 'unacceptable'
---'it had far better data mobile (network)connection then this one!' **** 'better'

Negative Reviews:

---'today most of the options are companies like sprint, at&t;, verizon and t-mobile (the cheaper and no longer require two year contracts) that offer cellphones extremely inexpensive ....hahaha yeah inexpensive = a two year phone contract where you are going to pay 90+ a year in average for unlimited voice and messages (which is needed less than data in todays standards) and a very limited plan for data.' **** 'less'
