---'apple store clearly would have replaced the phone with no questions asked.- it crashes a ton - camera, apps, everything- it restarts for no reason, sometime at really inopportune times - like driving with the navigation on- everything that can easily be done on apple takes a little more time on android (especially the poorly laid out settings, and inability to sync my phone easily with my computer)- battery cover is extremely flimsy, replaced it twice so far.' **** 'inopportune'

---'while the phone gets alot of good reviews, those reviews fail to note this phone has poor battery life (huge issue) and the overall call quality is only so-so.first the good.' **** 'overall'
---'to be clear, i do not think this is an issue with verizon as much as a problem with the phone, but i could be wrong about that.it remains to be seen what i can do about this, but i do not recommend this phone at all, due to the serious call issues and data signal drops.' **** 'serious'
---"it's not a dropped call, it's total loss of radio signal." **** 'dropped'

Negative Reviews:

---"i'm in the middle of a call with my friend and all of a sudden the call abruptly ends." **** 'sudden'
---'if you are on a call for any length you will start to hear small bits of radio type interference and then the whole call goes bad.' **** 'bad'
---"4g on this phone for means it's is ready for the future.i used to think motorola phones always had the best call quality, not any more!" **** 'best'

---'just write a simple review.' **** 'simple'
---"the nexus is slim enough that i don't notice the curvature of the device in my pocket, unless i'm deliberately paying attention to it.the review wouldn't be complete without at least some mention of the upgraded android os, so i will just mention a very small number of features i enjoy with the update, although that will barely scratch the surface of the new version's feature set.the new lock screen is nice." **** 'complete'
---'i will admit, i am on my phone a lot also, so for people that  may not be on their phone as much throughout the day, they may not need to carry a charger at all times.thanks, i hope this review was helpful!' **** 'helpful'
---"* google wallet still does not work on verizonon the positive side...* facebook contact syncing is now available through free third-party apps* the phone has gotten somewhat cheaper* the phone can now tether without root, thanks to newly-enforced fcc regulations upon verizon=== original review follows ===(updated 12/19/11 to correct misinformation about google wallet)intro & disclaimer------------------this is an early adopter's review intended to point out a few issues that weren't mentioned in most of the pre-release reviews." **** 'original'

---'the os is vastly improved in nearly all categories: native apps and services, 4g battery life, ui/ux, cohesiveness.' **** 'native'
---'running apps on it is fast and simple though i have run into some apps that are not fully compatible that lead to frequent app crash not a biggie but a little annoying.battery life is so-so to say and it really depends on your particular usage: power user vs normal user.' **** 'simple'
---'i also love that the buttons on the bottom (home, back and recent apps) disappear when watching a movie.' **** 'recent'

---'the camera itself has far more capabilities than the software allow... a simple update will remedy this, or there are alternative camera apps available on the market now.' **** 'available'
---'voicemail breaks with access not allowed or not setup.i\'m going back to apple as soon as the iphone 5 is released next month.since this phone is now illegal to sale in retail stores now is a good time to unload it.any takers on a good used phone?prosalthough vz does not support google wallet, downloading a boot leg copy showcases nfc technology at paypass.ignore the "update wallet" prompt because it will later break google wallet.nfc chip cannot read through a thick protective case.fast 4g lte speeds 8 to 20 mbps.consicf os buggy at times impacting the camera and other apps.' **** 'other'
---'i ran cyanogenmod 7 since ~fall 2011 and then 7.2 rc\'s until replacing the evo altogether.pro\'s:--phone is very thin.--clear, vibrant 4.65" super amoled hd screen with higher-than-average resolution (720x1280 vs. the more typical 480x800).--the ability to use small-sized system-wide fonts on the higher-resolution screen is great.--excellent lte speeds when available.--voice quality in phone calls has been above average in my experience.--ice cream sandwich is rather nice once you get used to it.--phone zips between screens and changes between apps with little to no appreciable lag.--vibration works well--not overly powerful, nor too weak.--boots pleasantly quickly.--802.11n wifi radio works rather well for me (although some claim to have range issues).--you can change out to a fresh battery when charging isn\'t an option (skipped the htc one x for this very reason).--i very much appreciate the mostly "pure google" aspect of this phone and lack of bloatware or carrier-implemented restrictions (although, technically, it\'s not nearly the "pure google" experience of a gsm galaxy nexus).con\'s:--perhaps *too* thin by default?' **** 'little'
---'various other bugs that may be android related, rather than specific to this phone: text messages sometimes get "stuck" until you send another one (especially mms ones containing pictures), apps crash, impossible to get rid of google\'s apps that you never use, and then those apps bug you to update them, etc, etc.' **** 'impossible'

Negative Reviews:

---'it can do a very good sync with google apps.' **** 'google'
---"i believed in all the good reviews i read but with an extremely erratic network connection that consumed my patience the phone turned up to be a complete fiasco.the 4g and network connection was intermitent most of the time disconnected, with in la city- could not make phone calls most of the time- if phone call went thru, it wouldn't take long before the call was dropped and service lost- brief internet browsing (4g) only to loose connection shortly after- apps would stop working due to lost of network connection (4g)- if connected to a wifi you can use it only forgett about the phonesamsung offer to repair...forgett about google youl'll get ignoredjust as a side note, verizon's reps, wether over the phone or at their corporate offices will discourage you about your phone aquisicition thru amazon- refusal to activate your new phone, they will refer you back to amazon- they'll warn you that no manufacture's wrranty support thru verizon- i was told that amazon is not an authorized retailer by verizonin few words the galaxy nexus turned out to be a blood sucker" **** 'due'
