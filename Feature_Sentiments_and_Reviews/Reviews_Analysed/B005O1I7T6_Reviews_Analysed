---'it sucks samsung didn\'t include a way to disable that feature in the settings since this is a prepaid phone and unintentional browser use could eat precious minutes.the good: for me the phone\'s low cost, slide out keyboard, and tracfone\'s low cost for talk & text when considering the "triple minutes for life" of the phone were the selling points.' **** 'low'
