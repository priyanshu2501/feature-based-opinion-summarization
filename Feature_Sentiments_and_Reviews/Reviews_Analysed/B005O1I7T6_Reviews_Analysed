---'the person who complained about not being able to see the keyboard must have gotten a bad phone as mine lights up bright enough to see anywhere.' **** 'able'
---"I use it primarily for calls and texts and as an alarm clock, and sometimes for taking pictures and videosPros- TRIPLE MINUTES is GREAT, full keyboard, keys are spaced out well to limit typos, feels solid, good battery life, Cons- Won't tell you who a text is from until you open the text and spend minutes; keyboard is easy to use, and it works fine about 90% of the time but it will sometimes type double characters when you press a key, I have found that the best way to solve this is to type with quick hard strokes, though most of the time you can just type normally; has some trouble opening picture messages, sometimes it would shutdown and restart when I tried to open a pic message; makes an annoying &#34; diddlydoo&#34; sound when doing everything from opening a text message to saving an alarm time, the only way to turn this sound off is putting it on vibrate mode (by holding down the &#34;#&#34; key) although you can interrupt the sound by pressing a key quickly after the sound starts; camera is nothing special (but hey, it's a phone camera) although occasionally a picture will turn out surprisingly wellOverall it's a fairly cheap phone, I paid $30 for it, but it gets the job done, and of course triple minutes is great." **** 'easy'
---'The phone has a good feel and the keyboard is quite comfortable, even for adult hands.' **** 'comfortable'
