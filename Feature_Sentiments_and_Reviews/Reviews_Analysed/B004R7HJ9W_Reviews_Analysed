---"opera mini and google maps already installed--good because opera provides access to web resources most phone web browsers don't, and google maps lets you use the gps without paying to use virgin mobile's one.so many other phones like this make it hard not to accidentally open the web browser, but not this one.the bad:keypad is good size, but the two-level keys limit the size of the text on the keys and seems a poor third choice to the usual domed keys or slightly separated ones.sprint coverage has not been as good as the other major carriers--or even cricket--where i live.sprint locks the phone so it only allows use of the included ringtones or those purchased from virgin mobile." **** 'usual'
