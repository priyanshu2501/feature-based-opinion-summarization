---"6-volume adjustment:  frequently I want to turn volume off before I turn on a video so I won't disturb people around me; instead, the volume adjuster adjusts the ringer; it's a three step process to turn down volume (volume button, select audio, adjust slider); I know this isn't a typical use case, but i'd love a simple (not a recessed-where-I-can't-get-to-it  button) to switch off all sound in one gesture." **** "recessed-where-i-can't-get-to-it"
