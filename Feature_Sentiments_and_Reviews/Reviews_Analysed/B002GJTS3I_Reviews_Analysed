Positive Reviews:

---"i guess the bottom line is that the keyboard and track-ball are slow and unresponsive, and the sound quality is mediocre to poor ... and the thing is twice the size and weight of the pearl, a huge brick in my pocket that gave nothing back in exchange for the extra size and weight.so now, the pearl is back in my pocket and i'm really appreciating it." **** 'unresponsive'

Negative Reviews:

---'i\'ll list the bad stuff first, then the good stuff, so make sure you read it all...i waited 6 months for the phone to come out, then waited a month to buy one so as not to risk getting a "buggy" new one.after the purchase on aug 7, my results were as follows:  transmit audio quality is poor (low treble) with the built in mic unless i cup my hand around the bottom of the phone, so the other person has a hard time understanding me sometimes; trackball motion is extremely erratic - it moves anywhere from 0% to 100% of what was expected, but usually 20% to 50%, and far too often it doesn\'t move at all - one time i rolled it seven times before it even budged; keyboard has a nice feel but i am new to bb so it will take a little getting used to typing with my thumbs - but i have xl hands and i can see that it is completely workable - i am a little slow, but i make almost no typos, which is way better than i did on the storm or the iphone when testing them; the back is loose, making it feel cheap; screen quality and sound are amazing; photo quality seems very good but i am not fussy about that since the camera is an "extra" to me; headphones are decent, but they sound much bassier (better) when you hold them in your ear.my favorite features: 1) instant email reception; 2) automatic synching with my work ms outlook email and contacts; 3)pandora!' **** 'good'
