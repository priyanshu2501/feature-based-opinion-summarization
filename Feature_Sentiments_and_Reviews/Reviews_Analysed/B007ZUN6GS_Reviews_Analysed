---'trying to get sprint to do anything about the phones or acknowledge a problem has been a story for another day to be told over seven pitchers of margaritas.while sprint keeps blaming their network for the connection issues, nobody can explain why four separate evo lte phones (all four brand new) cannot keep and hold a 3g connection when older phones can do so and do it faster.' **** 'separate'

---'a few separate sprint reps speculated that a weaker antenna or chipset may be in the new evo, but couldn\'t explain why a company would do this, especially one with a 4g network that is probably going to take three or more years to roll out.if you google "evo 4g lte" and "3g connection issues", and look at some of the negative reviews here, you\'ll see i\'m not alone.' **** 'new'

---"i'm giving the phone 5 stars because it is great, however sprint got a little ahead of themselves with this phone, as the lte netwpork isn't even up and running yet in most areas, including mine...so my phone can't connect or it gets cut off from internet connection often because it doesn't run on the sweet 4g network, like the old evo." **** 'sweet'
---"i honestly believe its part the phone's fault and part that sprint's network is so bad." **** 'bad'
---'i wish i bought the s3 instead and lost any favor for htc and have lost respect for sprint for releasing an product before their network is ready and the bugs are worked out of the product, consequently offering inferior performance, but still think they provide the best customer service.updatei actually got  the samsung s3 and i  must admit, i  think the htc evo 4g lte was a better phone.' **** 'ready'
