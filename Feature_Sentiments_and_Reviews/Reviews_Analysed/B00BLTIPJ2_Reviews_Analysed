__________('other', 'phones')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'below are the pros and cons of this device.pros- it is a world phone- it has physical buttons- the hinge for the lid when you flip the phone up feels solid- when you cover the charger port back up, it has a secure seal, unlike other phones where the cover piece feels cheap.- the battery lasts for days.- the audio quality for the ear piece and speaker phone sounds pretty good.- the ringer is loud and stays at the same loud volume i have it set to, loud enough for me to hear it across the room.- the microphone to talk into is below the number pad.- it can download mp3 ringtones and wallpapers- it displays text messages individually- it does not require a data plan.cons- when typing a text message, even if i have the abc mode selected, sometimes the phone will not let me capitalize a letter and i have to press the * key numerous times to cycle through the text input modes before i can type the capital letter i want.- the camera on this device is not the greatest, but it does the job okay.- the phone only comes with one game, which does not bother me, but it could be a problem for those who like to have games on their smart or basic phones.- it accidentally takes pictures of the inside of my pocket if i do not have the phone in a case.' **** 'other'

__________('sound', 'quality')__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"i will start with a brief list of the positives on these phones.it's durable, has a good music player and it is water-proof (but then again, so is a rock and the rock would have better sound quality).with that out of the way, let's touch on a few of the many negatives.poor sound quality, you sound like you're underwater even when you're not.eptt is pathetic for so many reasons:  logs you out constantly, alert volume is non-existent, eptt volume is tied directly to ringer volume (how non-intuitive is that?" **** 'better'
