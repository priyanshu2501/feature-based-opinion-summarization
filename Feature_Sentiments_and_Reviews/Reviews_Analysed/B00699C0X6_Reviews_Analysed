Negative Reviews:

---'great phone, performs ok not great no lags so far camera is good but definitely  not great.the 3d works as advertised no headaches, my only issue is the battery if you do anything media related the battery will have to be charged at least 2-3 times per day that really sucks.' **** 'good'
---'if you are a 3d lover, this its the phone for you; it does everything a modern smart phone do plus a little more, maby isnt the fastest phone or powerfull as an s3, but it has a great screen 4.3 (bigger than iphone) also it does stream hdmi directly to your flat tv via hdmi conector (i use to it to see 3d movies on my 55" flat screen, and i love it) camera its great, i think i like this one over the new 3dmax since this one have hdmi connector, i strongly recomend to buy a protective case also, bigger screens are prone to crack if droped, best phone i had so far...update jan 2014: i still have this phone, broke the screen digitizer and replaced it myself, but it went sorta buggy and for the today phones specs are a sorta oudated, im using a p720 3dmax actually and gave this one to wife as second phone, the p970 its far better but it became scarce in the market, still for 160$ this phone its a very good bang for your bucks if you looking for a 3d portable camera and a small device for looking 3d pics and movies"what this phone can do that  samsumg s3 and iphone cant:-  take 3d photos and video-  watch 3d pictures and videos (join phereo community share and see 3d pictures around the world)- stream 1080p 3d and normal video to tvs using hdmi  cable (included)- play 3d games' **** 'portable'

Negative Reviews:

---"if you plan to use the phone for anything length of time, don't expect the battery to last you more than a few hours." **** 'last'
---"again, these are well known issues; look at lg's forum, and notice the thrill is the most popular topic, and look at the most popular threads...there are also issues with the touchscreen - if i play an intensive 3d game (including the bundled nova 2) the touch screen eventually stops responding to multitouch.the phone will randomly overheat and run the whole battery in a few minutes." **** 'whole'

---"it will also randomly shut off and not turn back on until the battery is removed and reinserted.the screen is nice, and the 3d feature is very cool, but the cameras are too close together so the 3d depth from photos/videos you record isn't that good." **** 'nice'
