---'I picked up the MotoMing from Amazon and i love the phone it does all that i wanted in the smartphone.. e-mail, internet access, pictures, calender and more... couple of problems that came with it though... 1)the phone came programed in chinese, took me a while to figure out how to change it to english... 2)all access internet links and email links are hong kong based links, not usable for me and the help is not quite good enought to change it, got it figured out with the help of a friends smartphone, checked her settings and aligned mine to similar (not same since we use different carriers)... 3)the final problem i have with it is the sensitivity of the touch screen, sometime touching my face is enough to shut off a call, putting a screen protecter on it reduced this sensitivity..... Other then these listed problems i love my Ming, small but complete, it is 1/2 the size of other smart phones, i still use my PDA and can link the two of them with the blue tooth connection..... Hope you find this information helpful.... D' **** 'touch'
