Positive Reviews:

---"the tactile feel is great.this phone does not have a lot of functionalities - but it does what a cell phone is supposed to do well.i did find the english version manual googling, and it was available from samsung's own website for download.and i am glad i read the manual because i was under the impression the tx9 predictive typing was not available for english, but it is.the back lid is not easy to open, but i find that a nickel coin does the trick without risking scratching the nice screw.the lid pops open when you turn the screw past the unlock-mark.it's too bad that now a days all service providers are focusing on smart phones for the revenue they generate in the u.s., so good, purpose-built cell phones like this are no longer available through regular channels." **** 'bad'
---"i've left my phone on for 3 days straight now and it's still at full bars (but that's with minimum usage)." **** 'straight'
---'* battery life is great, average lifespan i experience is on average 3 days i have only needed to charge it 2-3 times in the two weeks  i have owned it.theres so much more, but i do want to note a couple things1.' **** 'average'
