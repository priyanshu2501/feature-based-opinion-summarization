---"since i have been using windows mobile devices for years i was reluctant to buy a phone with a different os but now that i have seen just how wonderful android is i am very happy that i made the switch.first of all the samsung vibrant is one of the most powerful phones on the market today,it has a 1ghz hummingbird processor,512mb of ram and enough graphics processing power to let you play a game like quake 3 with ease.you really need to use the phone yourself to see how beautiful games and movies look on the vibrants display,the videos on youtube don't do it justice.the one thing i did not look forward to was using a touchscreen to type since i was used to a physical qwerty keypad but after about an hour using the on screen keys it became second nature to use.as for navigating through the menus all you do is give a gentle swipe with your finger or thumb and that's it,simple,no problems with response time,no annoying slowdown,hands down the most hassle free way to navigate a mobile device.as for the sound and call quality everything is clear,both the front and rear speaker do their job well,i just wish the rear speaker was a little louder,but this is a minor complaint.while using the vibrant to make calls i found that the signal was strong,people i talked to said they could hear me fine and they also came in loud and clear.if you're in a 3g area you will find web pages load in seconds but if you're not you would be better served by using the wifi feature,the only downside of this is that wifi drains the battery fast so only use it when you have to.speaking of the battery it lasts quite a long time even when using 3g data,playing games or watching movies for hours on end.i have only used the gps navigation service twice so far but i can say it is very accurate,i got to my destination with no problems whatsoever.there is a camera on the back of the vibrant that takes photos and records videos which look very nice even when displayed on an hdtv.the one major issue i worried about coming from a windows mobile device was losing all those apps i have become so fond of such as coreplayer,my fear was unfounded for the most part,even though coreplayer isn't out for android yet.documents to go,slick messenger,skype and tons of other great apps are available now and work just as well (if not better) on the android os.if you like to use your device as a music player and load it up with mp3's you will fall in love with this thing,not only does it have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack but it also has 16gb of internal storage,of course a lot of this storage is used for other things but no worries,you can pop in a 16gb or 32gb micro sd card and you're set.i have not even talked about the other outstanding feature of the vibrant,it has video/audio out via the 3.5mm jack!you can buy some cheap cables right here on amazon and have your phones hd display on your tv,this is a feature that should be standard on all future smartphones.i could go on and on about how this thing will change your life but all that's left to say is give it a try and i bet you will love it.enjoy :)update: 2-17-2011after having this phone for a few months i have decided to return it.after getting the android 2.2 froyo update the phones battery life was cut in half and many apps now force close at least once a day,this phone really can't handle froyo well but that's only one of the problems i have run into.the fact that it has no front facing camera makes it impossible to do video chat over wifi without constantly turning phone around so other person can see me,the back of the device gets very hot at times especially when playing 3d games,the gps works great at times and then says you're over a mile from where you really are!i know for a fact that this is not due to weak signal since the person with me used another phone on same network with the same app and had no gps problems.bottom line is that the vibrants hardware flaws keep it from being the device it could have been.i still like the android os,froyo is very slick but you will be better served using it on another device." **** 'long'

---"since i have been using windows mobile devices for years i was reluctant to buy a phone with a different os but now that i have seen just how wonderful android is i am very happy that i made the switch.first of all the samsung vibrant is one of the most powerful phones on the market today,it has a 1ghz hummingbird processor,512mb of ram and enough graphics processing power to let you play a game like quake 3 with ease.you really need to use the phone yourself to see how beautiful games and movies look on the vibrants display,the videos on youtube don't do it justice.the one thing i did not look forward to was using a touchscreen to type since i was used to a physical qwerty keypad but after about an hour using the on screen keys it became second nature to use.as for navigating through the menus all you do is give a gentle swipe with your finger or thumb and that's it,simple,no problems with response time,no annoying slowdown,hands down the most hassle free way to navigate a mobile device.as for the sound and call quality everything is clear,both the front and rear speaker do their job well,i just wish the rear speaker was a little louder,but this is a minor complaint.while using the vibrant to make calls i found that the signal was strong,people i talked to said they could hear me fine and they also came in loud and clear.if you're in a 3g area you will find web pages load in seconds but if you're not you would be better served by using the wifi feature,the only downside of this is that wifi drains the battery fast so only use it when you have to.speaking of the battery it lasts quite a long time even when using 3g data,playing games or watching movies for hours on end.i have only used the gps navigation service twice so far but i can say it is very accurate,i got to my destination with no problems whatsoever.there is a camera on the back of the vibrant that takes photos and records videos which look very nice even when displayed on an hdtv.the one major issue i worried about coming from a windows mobile device was losing all those apps i have become so fond of such as coreplayer,my fear was unfounded for the most part,even though coreplayer isn't out for android yet.documents to go,slick messenger,skype and tons of other great apps are available now and work just as well (if not better) on the android os.if you like to use your device as a music player and load it up with mp3's you will fall in love with this thing,not only does it have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack but it also has 16gb of internal storage,of course a lot of this storage is used for other things but no worries,you can pop in a 16gb or 32gb micro sd card and you're set.i have not even talked about the other outstanding feature of the vibrant,it has video/audio out via the 3.5mm jack!you can buy some cheap cables right here on amazon and have your phones hd display on your tv,this is a feature that should be standard on all future smartphones.i could go on and on about how this thing will change your life but all that's left to say is give it a try and i bet you will love it.enjoy :)update: 2-17-2011after having this phone for a few months i have decided to return it.after getting the android 2.2 froyo update the phones battery life was cut in half and many apps now force close at least once a day,this phone really can't handle froyo well but that's only one of the problems i have run into.the fact that it has no front facing camera makes it impossible to do video chat over wifi without constantly turning phone around so other person can see me,the back of the device gets very hot at times especially when playing 3d games,the gps works great at times and then says you're over a mile from where you really are!i know for a fact that this is not due to weak signal since the person with me used another phone on same network with the same app and had no gps problems.bottom line is that the vibrants hardware flaws keep it from being the device it could have been.i still like the android os,froyo is very slick but you will be better served using it on another device." **** 'happy'

---"since i have been using windows mobile devices for years i was reluctant to buy a phone with a different os but now that i have seen just how wonderful android is i am very happy that i made the switch.first of all the samsung vibrant is one of the most powerful phones on the market today,it has a 1ghz hummingbird processor,512mb of ram and enough graphics processing power to let you play a game like quake 3 with ease.you really need to use the phone yourself to see how beautiful games and movies look on the vibrants display,the videos on youtube don't do it justice.the one thing i did not look forward to was using a touchscreen to type since i was used to a physical qwerty keypad but after about an hour using the on screen keys it became second nature to use.as for navigating through the menus all you do is give a gentle swipe with your finger or thumb and that's it,simple,no problems with response time,no annoying slowdown,hands down the most hassle free way to navigate a mobile device.as for the sound and call quality everything is clear,both the front and rear speaker do their job well,i just wish the rear speaker was a little louder,but this is a minor complaint.while using the vibrant to make calls i found that the signal was strong,people i talked to said they could hear me fine and they also came in loud and clear.if you're in a 3g area you will find web pages load in seconds but if you're not you would be better served by using the wifi feature,the only downside of this is that wifi drains the battery fast so only use it when you have to.speaking of the battery it lasts quite a long time even when using 3g data,playing games or watching movies for hours on end.i have only used the gps navigation service twice so far but i can say it is very accurate,i got to my destination with no problems whatsoever.there is a camera on the back of the vibrant that takes photos and records videos which look very nice even when displayed on an hdtv.the one major issue i worried about coming from a windows mobile device was losing all those apps i have become so fond of such as coreplayer,my fear was unfounded for the most part,even though coreplayer isn't out for android yet.documents to go,slick messenger,skype and tons of other great apps are available now and work just as well (if not better) on the android os.if you like to use your device as a music player and load it up with mp3's you will fall in love with this thing,not only does it have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack but it also has 16gb of internal storage,of course a lot of this storage is used for other things but no worries,you can pop in a 16gb or 32gb micro sd card and you're set.i have not even talked about the other outstanding feature of the vibrant,it has video/audio out via the 3.5mm jack!you can buy some cheap cables right here on amazon and have your phones hd display on your tv,this is a feature that should be standard on all future smartphones.i could go on and on about how this thing will change your life but all that's left to say is give it a try and i bet you will love it.enjoy :)update: 2-17-2011after having this phone for a few months i have decided to return it.after getting the android 2.2 froyo update the phones battery life was cut in half and many apps now force close at least once a day,this phone really can't handle froyo well but that's only one of the problems i have run into.the fact that it has no front facing camera makes it impossible to do video chat over wifi without constantly turning phone around so other person can see me,the back of the device gets very hot at times especially when playing 3d games,the gps works great at times and then says you're over a mile from where you really are!i know for a fact that this is not due to weak signal since the person with me used another phone on same network with the same app and had no gps problems.bottom line is that the vibrants hardware flaws keep it from being the device it could have been.i still like the android os,froyo is very slick but you will be better served using it on another device." **** 'long'
