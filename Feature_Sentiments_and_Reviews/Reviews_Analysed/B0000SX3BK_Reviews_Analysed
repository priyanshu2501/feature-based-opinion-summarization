---'i have been with nextel and have had the best service, compared with my former carriers, cingular & verizon.' **** 'best'
---"i've had my i730 from when it first came out and it was my first nextel phone but i've switched my sim card into other nextel phones (a convenient feature of motorola cells) and didn't see much of a significant difference in service." **** 'other'
---'t-mobile service was not bad at all, but i don\'t think that in the 2 or 3 years i was with them i was ever satisfied with my phone -- the volume was too low, the speakerphone was a joke, the phone was too big, reception was horrible, it kept on dying, etc, etc.i then switched to nextel because i was tired of the billing errors involved with handsent replaments (out of warranty fees -- when the phone wasn\'t even 3 months old, re-stocking fees for phones i "didnt return" according to t-mobile, etc, etc).' **** 'bad'
---"it's less than my first startac ($399 vs $499) and i am very happy with my nextel service (much more clear than sprint)." **** 'happy'
---'customer service for nextel is poor at best.' **** 'best'
---'out of all the phones and services,nextel is the best for me.' **** 'best'

---"not only does nextel have far and above the best service in the wireless industry, but now they've unleashed the best phone with the new i730." **** 'best'
---'the main thing i do not like (that my last nextel phone had) was that it no longer (that i have found) has the loud ring and vibrate capability (as in ringing and vibrating at the same time) the only service draw back is that is that all the plans are between 20-50 percent higher then other wireless providers.' **** 'last'
