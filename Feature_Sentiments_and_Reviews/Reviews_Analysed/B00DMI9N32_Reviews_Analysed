---"pros: inexpensive smartphone that can do most of the things of the more expensive phones, loaded with jellybean 4.2, unlocked, dual sim, works with china mobile in china and at&t; in the us, bright screen, comes with case and screen protector, sd card slotcons: only 512 mb of ram which limits multi-tasking and more memory-intensive games, screen attracts fingerprints, mediocre camera (but you cannot expect great image quality at this price range), difficult to remove the case and figure out where to insert the sim cardif you only call, text, surf the web, facebook, play basic games like angry birds, and don't run many apps at the same time, there is no need to pay more for an expensive smartphone." **** 'bright'
