__________('straight', 'talk')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"(disclaimer)...since there are no separate reviews for this phone on the straight talk network here on amazon, i decided to put one here.we do offer boost mobile in nebraska but it is limited to the large cities so this review does apply to the phone and less to the provider.i've had my straight talk blackberry 9310 for about two weeks now and am pretty happy with it." **** 'straight'
---'switched to a samsung b2710 but recently went to straight talk when i saw the 9310 show up on the scene.overall, i would say the user experience is similar to the 8900, all of the usual bb features are there.' **** 'straight'

Negative Reviews:

---"while i haven't tried to connect it to my playbook with bb bridge, i've read that straight talk blocks this." **** 'read'
---"while i haven't tried to connect it to my playbook with bb bridge, i've read that straight talk blocks this." **** 'straight'
---"there are some times where the voice quality can get a bit garbled but i blame the carrier and not the phone because in general the voice quality is fine.i do love the fact that my accessories such as headset and power charger are compatible from the 8900 but one thing i would like to do, simply so i wouldn't have to pack an extra charger when i travel is use my playbook charger with my 9310. while i've read this is possible, i have also heard some horror stories about how this fried or messed up the batteries of certain bb phones so for now, i wont be using the pb charger on the curve.for $45 for the unlimited minute, text and data plan, i really can't complain and straight talk has been around long enough that i don't think it is going away any time soon." **** 'straight'
