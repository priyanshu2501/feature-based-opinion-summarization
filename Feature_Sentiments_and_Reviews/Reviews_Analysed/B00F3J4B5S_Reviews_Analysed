__________('problem',)__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"the iphone 5s is a pretty amazing phone and i would get the next version, when it comes out, if it weren't for the following major problem:apple has programmed the ios so that all messages, inbound and outbound, including attachments, are saved on the phone with absolutely no option, within the os, to delete them.sure, they let the user think they have deleted the messages and attachments, but a quick dive into the phone's list of memory hogs shows that the messages app is taking up more and more space every day.if you enjoy sending and receiving pictures and videos via message, every time you do, it deletes from your available memory with no option, within the os, to recover the memory that was just used.now some people, in the conspiracy world, may think that this is a way for your personal messages to be recovered or spied on.... but i think the reason is more insidious." **** 'major'
