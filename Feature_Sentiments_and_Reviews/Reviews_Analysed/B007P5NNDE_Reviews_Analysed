Negative Reviews:

---"i suggest looking into the wp marketplace to see if they have the apps you are looking for before buying this phone...if you are just looking for a phone to browse the internet at lte speed, integrated social media...this phone rocks!pros:- great feel to the polycarbonate..doesn't feel cheap when you hold it- nokia drive ---been using nokia drive since symbian and google navigation doesn't match to the quality of this gps navigation...and its free with off line mapping....it also has like 50+ languges for voice navigation- at $99 for a premium phone...its a no brainer compare to $299 for high end androids or iphones- lte speed is fast compare to the old 3g- easily integrate with hotmail/google/yahoo mail/contacts/calendar- the cyan color turn heads when you use it waiting in line at costco- battery life last a full day on medium use on lte with wifi and bluetooth turned off (my samsung galaxy sii will last about 5 hours before i need to charge it)- playing spotify on my samsung galaxy sii (4g) will last a bit less than 3 hours before i need to charge- nokia luma 900 playing spotify on lte wil last a good 5 hours before i need to charge it- i left both phone on playing spotify in a loop on my playlist- clear black amoled screen, easier to read outdoors in the sun- can link multiple email inboxes into one inbox for ease of use- group messaging so its easier to keep track of group texts in one thread instead of getting each text individually- ms office syncs to skydrive and i can edit on my pc and sync itcons:- feels a bit heavy compare to the sii and other phones because of the polycarbonate...doesn't feel plastic toy like a lot of phones out there- camera is descent but doesn't have the quality of the my nokia n8- no free tethering option- no skype integration yet- no removeable batteries- no usb mass storage option ....will have to go through zune...i go through skydrive for my files and ms gives you 20gb of data with windows phonethe pros for me outweight the cons and with nokia drive offline mapping, a $99 price tag (free till april 21st) this phone is a winner" **** 'last'
