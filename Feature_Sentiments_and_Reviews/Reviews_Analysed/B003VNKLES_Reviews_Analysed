__________('calendar',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"i don't travel a lot outside of california so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, i can wait until i need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.the other major issue is i use google calendar, right now you can use ms exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports all of my gmail contacts into my c6 even though i don't actively keep in touch with all of them, i suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option." **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---'however, my main phone is a samsung nexus s 4g from sprint because it is a pure google experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because i rely on gmail and google calendar and google everything apps, it just works for me.' **** 'google'
---'as for google calendar, there is a google mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for google calendar, so for my internet application i set my default homepage as the google calendar address so when i want to look at all (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my google calendars i just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by google.' **** 'google'
---'so i get my google calendar but via a webpage site, not the ovi calendar because like i said the ms exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.i also downloaded ovi software to my pc and the linking between the c6 and ovi software on my pc works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your pc to the c6, also faster way to update your c6 with software updates since you download them from the pc first and then link your c6 to the pc via a usb cable and the data transfer is faster.' **** 'main'

---'so the c6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time i took it i went to idaho and oregon on business) because the battery life on the c6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone ming a1200 was even better, a few days battery.' **** 'last'
---"i just got this phone and i'm loving it... i have had it for 3 days and it's way better than i expected... may be it's cuz i had a very very old crappy phone but this one is really getting in to me... it has 2 cameras, one to take pictures and another to video chat, it's so easy to use, the keys are very gentil and smooth (one of my biggest problem with the other every time i tried to type something it looked like i was killing the abc's)." **** 'other'
---"most likely because, they didn't take the time to updatefirmware to the latest version." **** 'likely'
---'the lag time is about 1 second or less, and for a large theme it can be up to 2 maybe 3 seconds.' **** 'second'
---"changing the stance of the phone (horizontal to vertical or vice versa) always gives a delay of a few seconds.at first this doesn't sound like too much of a bother but when you have to wait 15 seconds to reply to a text message or call, almost every single time, it becomes very annoying and can make you quite irritable." **** 'single'
---'battery time is good, better than my sony ericsson or apple.' **** 'good'
---'then inserted the t-mobile sim card and the phone worked right the first time.' **** 'first'
---'a little complicate for 1st time user, and the manual is not helpful.' **** 'complicate'

Positive Reviews:

---"i've been using the google android phone for the past 11 months and it did everything i needed it to do from paying for starbucks coffee using a starbucks app so i didn't need to carry my starbucks card around and accessing multiple ms exchange accounts to the interface and os being slick and nimble as well as google directions/mapping/gps; the major downside to smartphones such as android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the os and display especially." **** 'past'

Positive Reviews:

---"after searching for an unlocked cell phone since september, my research led me to the nokia c6.the ease of use is remarkable, the touchscreen easy to navigate and the 5 mp takes sharp pictures for both developing or just wallpaper.the wifi option makes surfing the net w/out a data package quick and easy, especially with opera mobile as a browser.i'd strongly recommend this phone for someone who wants to avoid shelling out hundreds more for an iphone.one caveat is that you want to add as much memory as affordable in order to make surfing quicker and increase the cache for temp files and downloads." **** 'unlocked'
