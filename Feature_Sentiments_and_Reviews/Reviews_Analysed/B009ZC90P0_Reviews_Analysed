---"the only reason i bought that phone is nokia.i had four nokias in the past and was always happy with them.i must say that i think the best phone os out there is android.i dislike iphones os, interface, non customization and design failures (maybe on their 20th phone it would be fixed).the 920 right now has the best camera, best screen and best build quality.the 920's screen is unbreakable." **** 'best'

---'- screen has perfect size and brightness - good view even in direct sunlight of the most sunny days- almost indestructible - and yes, i needed that :) search for it at youtube and you will see the kind of "read-life" resistance tests that this phone passes...- best camera - same quality of a good point and shoot; image stabilization allows for good photos without flash- 32gb storage is more than enough to store music and lots of photos.' **** 'best'
---"i've also thought about the 820, which has micro sd slot but with a lower end camera, display and 8gb ram, the 920 is worthy of their price.the camera:this is one of the main reason i got this phone:  the pureview technology 8.7mp is awesome in low light!" **** 'worthy'
