Positive Reviews:

---'after coming off a samsung moment which had terrible battery life i went for this mainly because it had the best battery life of any of their phones.' **** 'best'
---'(versus limited availability on iphone and only if you jailbreak it)* has very intuitive back and menu/settings buttons (versus just a home button)* flash is supported* free turn-by-turn directions* real tabs in dolphin browsers (versus multiple taps needed to other windows)* dolphin browser is noticeably faster--even on wifi (versus safari/iphone)* alarm with gradually increasing volume is quite nice* a light tap on the home button does the trick (versus actually pressing it)* hdmi port* free google reader app (versus no app available)* can customize battery usage and manage/terminate tasks* you can sync most data over the mobile network (versus only wifi)* no personal info needed to download apps (versus have to enter your billing address even to download a free app)iphone/ios advantages* displays more pixels (960 x 640 versus 960 x 540)* higher/crisper screen resolution since more pixels are crammed into a smaller screen area* better screen color (more natural, accurate)* much better camera (more natural, accurate, warmer colors; crisper details; shorter "shutter" delay; tap focus) especially for indoor or low-light environments* seems to have longer battery life (photon screen is larger and usually brighter and doesn\'t fade after 30 seconds or so of idleness)* cutting/copying and pasting is easier* slicker interface, transitions, sliders, etc.' **** 'longer'
---"the snap-off and snap-on kevlar back is thin but so tough that you can forcibly rip it off without damaging it, and unlike iphone, you can carry spare batteries, swap them out and reboot the phone in a couple of minutes.i must say, i've read most of the negative comments about this phone, but for the life of me i don't know what they're talking about, except for poor battery life (but see my two battery life solutions below)." **** 'poor'
---"the larger battery and back cover i picked up at a minimal price on ebay does make a difference due to almost twice the capacity of photon's regular sized battery (oversized batteries and cases to accommodate them are available as an inexpensive option for a large number of different brand phones - i bought a similar kit for my razr phone)." **** 'larger'
