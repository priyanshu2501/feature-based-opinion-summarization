Positive Reviews:

---"buying the phone unlocked enabled me to just pop in my existing sim and use the phone with my provider (cingular).here are the reasons i didn't give this phone 5 stars (you can judge how important they are to you):1) lack of bluetooth2) camera is ok at best - don't use it for graduation photos :-)3) low screen resolution (still good and usable, but res could be better)4) not graffiti enabled (although i purchased third party software [jot] that works great).if items 1, 2, and 3 are a problem to you, then you might want to try the treo 650, which costs a little more, but addresses those shortcomings." **** 'low'
