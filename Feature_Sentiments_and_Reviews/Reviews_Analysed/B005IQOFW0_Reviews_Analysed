---"this week i traveled solo with my droid bionic and the lapdock accessory and believe i'm ready to permanently leave behind my laptop, ipad etc...in favor of my bionic coupled with the lapdock.pros:  battery life is great (regular use, with 4g on, i have 40-50% left at the end of the workday), speed is lightening fast (moving from screen to screen, opening/closing apps) and the data speed with 4g is faster than my home network (comcast), the mobile hotspot has displaced my need for hotel / internet wifi, and the lapdock is fantastic (charges phone while docked, battery life is good for a full day with all-day use)!cons:  expensive (for now) - but expect prices will drop.i don't anticipate replacing this setup for some time - can't think of much more that i would improve in a new(er) phone." **** 'good'

Positive Reviews:

---'as a power user, this mean 1-2 days (upwards of 8 hours) of reinstalling all of my programs, then getting them all running how i needed them.given all of the issues i was having, i had the local verizon store swap out my device for another new one, figuring it had to be an aberration.i am now on my third bionic in less than 2 months, have had the screen freeze (requiring a factory reset) 4 times now.' **** 'less'

---"the phone just gets better and better!there are so many negative reviews - it leads me to believe a lot of these folks may be on their first droid and don't understand what an awesome device this is - especially if you compare it to the rest of the droid market.i've used the 1st generation droid, the htc evo, the samsung charge, and i have to say this is hands down the best of those by a huge margin." **** 'first'

---'without worrying about the $250.00 charge3) they will waive the fee if your equipment is lost or stolentheoretically i suppose you could order the phone, claim it has been lost/stolen and have amazon wireless waive the fee, cancel your data plan, pay your $9.99 a month to verizon and place a "dummy" phone on the line you created, and wait for 181 days to pass--then miraculously recover your lost/stolen bionic and place it on whatever number you want.i searched online for 3-4 hours last night trying to confirm this information so i hope it helps someone who is weighing their options with this sweet deal.thanks for reading.' **** 'last'

Negative Reviews:

---"this is apparently a problem with all bionics.so, anyway, i've only had it for five days, but so far i would give the bionic a very low score for the camera, the camcorder, the screen clarity/vibrance, reliability(it crashed within the first few hours i had it) and for the wonderful glitch that you get an annoying audio whine anytime you use headphones." **** 'first'

---'the lack of available ram (i believe the original droid shipped with 256mb) is totally dwarfed by what the bionic has (1gb).' **** 'original'

Negative Reviews:

---"the constant reboots continue, and the frequent data connection losses (mind you i never had an issue with my original droid or the droid x) are maddening.couple this with a major degradation in the quality of the accessories when compared to previous models (the droid x is probably the pinnacle of motorola's build quality it seems) and motorola has lost a loyal customer.if you are considering this generation of smart phones, i would strongly suggest you take a serious look at the htc rezound or wait for the samsung galaxy nexus to compare these devices instead of the bionic." **** 'original'
---"while i vaguely wish it had the droid 3's keypad, i am highly impressed with the speed and responsiveness of the bionic, especially in comparison to my previous phone (the original droid).the camera in particular doesn't suffer from the same lag as that i found on the original droid, and i have yet to notice any pausing or stuttering in processor-intensive apps (angry birds had issues for me on the original droid, but has none with the bionic)." **** 'original'

---'i have absolutely no remorse at buying this phone knowing that had i waited 30ish days i could have gotten a better one.' **** 'better'

Negative Reviews:

---"i thought about ordering the bionic for $0.01 and switching it to my primary line--then i would proceed to cancel my new line's data plan (which is required in order to get the phone at the discounted price) and theoretically pay $9.99 a month for the two years, which would end up costing me ~240.00 in the long run for this awesome phone.this however, can not be done without voiding the amazon wireless agreement which would have resulted in a $250.00 charge plus the $9.99 a month for two years service with verizon (total $490.00).the terms of service agreement with amazon wireless is a bit vague, but basically after talking to a representative from amazon wireless i can confirm that:1) the phone must stay on the line it was created on for 181 consecutive days to avoid the $250.00 charge2) you can not cancel your data plan during this 181 consecutive day span or you will be charged $250.003) you can change any other features except data (minutes, text messaging, etc.)" **** 'consecutive'

---'i seem to have fixed that problem by a factory reset and wiping all programs and data off the phone, but i am still waiting to see what will happen next.finally, i am unhappy that motorola and verizon followed the much-touted bionic so quickly with the improved razr.bottom line -- this phone has too many random problems, over three different handsets, for me to recommend it to anyone.' **** 'unhappy'
---'do yourself a favor and read the forums on this phone, especially the motorola forum and the verizon forum.at first, everything worked, i loved the speed, and i like the bigger screen for reading the web, and there was so much memory that i could have almost unlimited apps.after a short while, the data connection stopped working about 3/4 of the time.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---"motorola droid bionic is a nice phone with plenty of horse power.screenthe screen quality is pretty good but looking closer you might see little pixelation and have no match to the super amoled plus found on the galaxy 2 devices.processorthe dual core 1ghz omap processor is really fast, the phone is very fast and shows no obvious signs of lag and slowing down.battery lifedroid bionic got a big battery (1750mh), which is the largest on any of the verizon lte phones, but if you are an power user you might find yourself looking for the charger around 4 o'clock.camerathe camera quality is not the best in the market, if you own a droid x or x2 then you might know what i am talking about.overalldroid bionic is a phone what droid x2 should have, the months of delay, the total design overhaul; still droid bionic is not the phone we wanted it to be." **** 'largest'

---"search seems to 'know' what you are looking for...  rounding out the package:  screen is huge (almost embarrassingly so) touch is really responsive...put those together, and typing is super fast, yes, i'm typing as fast as i was on the bberry... probably faster because of the predictive words." **** 'super'
