---'i kept the phone about 20 days - but ultimately decided to send it back.1) the symbian os - it\'s dead, nokia is switching to maemo linux and i fear that does not bode well for future app development, as it is - the selection of quality applications for symbians60v5touch is pretty thin (though most of the basics are there)2) buggy os - would frequently get "unknown error" when trying to use the camera - i don\'t want to reboot my phone and wait 2 minutes+ to take a picture - this is likely to be addressed in a hopefully forthcoming os update but i don\'t want to take that gamble3) most of the os is touch optimized, but like windows mobile (and perhaps exacerbated by my fat fingers and the phone\'s small screen size - sometimes you just must use the stylus.4) i hate where the stylus is - i\'m right handed - i hold the phone in my left.' **** 'small'
