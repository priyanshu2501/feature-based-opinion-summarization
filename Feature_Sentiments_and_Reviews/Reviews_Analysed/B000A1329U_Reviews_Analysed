---'i purchased this phone because i really liked the design of the product and was happy with motorola products in the past.' **** 'happy'

---'the deal was basically the one on this website with a different headset(they had not come out with a motorola one i guess) i paid only $249.99 with a free bluetooth 2.4 ghz headset not the cheesy one, or the motorola one offered on amazon  it was a belltronics m3000 it was priced at 89.99 retail at the time(i hardly use it to be honest i found it online for 50.00 bucks when i wrote this i personally like the motorola one it was not available when i got the v3) and on top of that they rebate all of the $249.99!' **** 'available'

---'oct 7th 2005if you look carefully at these so called "bad reviews" you will notice most of them either don\'t know how to use the phone or may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from every manufacturer, every brand, every type of phone.now my wife & i have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, i got the black one she got the silver one.' **** 'bad'

Negative Reviews:

---"first off, the phone design is excellent.i would also like to quickly dispell some of the negative comments in the reviews below.multiple numbers can be added to individual contacts, and any serious buyer (as well as all those who claim the phone cannot do just this) should actually read the manual (also available on motorola's website) to see how it can be done easily.the low volume complaint is true, however, my previous phone (sony ericsson t610) had the same issue, so this was a moot point for me, as i was used to the lower volume of the earpiece.my phone can actually record video, granted it is a bit choppy, but the phone i received as of october had this feature enabled right out of the box.these seem to be the biggest reoccuring complaints, other than the slow interface, which i have found to be fine with a little trial and error, and again, reading the manual.cingular wireless has been good to work with, and even though i messed around with the phone a bit too much and locked the sim card, they were really nice and provided me with the proper key to unlock it (but they are not under review here - the phone is).i highly encourage a bit of research, a bit of skepticism, and of course if you still buy and don't approve, it's very easy to return a phone before 30 days on most contracts.this is the best phone i've purchased yet, and for that i give 5 stars.update: after 1 month of use...i still love this phone.a few other realizations:there are a number of websites available showing how to improve your device (legally and without voiding any warranties)." **** 'nice'

---"first off, the phone design is excellent.i would also like to quickly dispell some of the negative comments in the reviews below.multiple numbers can be added to individual contacts, and any serious buyer (as well as all those who claim the phone cannot do just this) should actually read the manual (also available on motorola's website) to see how it can be done easily.the low volume complaint is true, however, my previous phone (sony ericsson t610) had the same issue, so this was a moot point for me, as i was used to the lower volume of the earpiece.my phone can actually record video, granted it is a bit choppy, but the phone i received as of october had this feature enabled right out of the box.these seem to be the biggest reoccuring complaints, other than the slow interface, which i have found to be fine with a little trial and error, and again, reading the manual.cingular wireless has been good to work with, and even though i messed around with the phone a bit too much and locked the sim card, they were really nice and provided me with the proper key to unlock it (but they are not under review here - the phone is).i highly encourage a bit of research, a bit of skepticism, and of course if you still buy and don't approve, it's very easy to return a phone before 30 days on most contracts.this is the best phone i've purchased yet, and for that i give 5 stars.update: after 1 month of use...i still love this phone.a few other realizations:there are a number of websites available showing how to improve your device (legally and without voiding any warranties)." **** 'low'

---'the upgradeable memory, large display and the mp3 ring tones are nice however i cant seem to get the headset to play ring tones it only beeps l well this is my long report about the v3 razor phone and i would recommend it to anyone who wants cheap plans nice phones and good service i pay 39.99 a month for 650 minutes  the downside with my plan is it does not have nights and weekends but they give you 5000 a month and i only pay 39.99. i got rid of the text message thing a)50.00 for 650 minutes is sad and b) i hate text msgs especially those goons who have those super fast flip out keyboard cell phones(you can never respond in time i tell my friends to call me).' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"first off, the phone design is excellent.i would also like to quickly dispell some of the negative comments in the reviews below.multiple numbers can be added to individual contacts, and any serious buyer (as well as all those who claim the phone cannot do just this) should actually read the manual (also available on motorola's website) to see how it can be done easily.the low volume complaint is true, however, my previous phone (sony ericsson t610) had the same issue, so this was a moot point for me, as i was used to the lower volume of the earpiece.my phone can actually record video, granted it is a bit choppy, but the phone i received as of october had this feature enabled right out of the box.these seem to be the biggest reoccuring complaints, other than the slow interface, which i have found to be fine with a little trial and error, and again, reading the manual.cingular wireless has been good to work with, and even though i messed around with the phone a bit too much and locked the sim card, they were really nice and provided me with the proper key to unlock it (but they are not under review here - the phone is).i highly encourage a bit of research, a bit of skepticism, and of course if you still buy and don't approve, it's very easy to return a phone before 30 days on most contracts.this is the best phone i've purchased yet, and for that i give 5 stars.update: after 1 month of use...i still love this phone.a few other realizations:there are a number of websites available showing how to improve your device (legally and without voiding any warranties)." **** 'nice'

---"many would say take off the fish but i like it there and i like knowing when the call is coming before it even rings.... so my conclusion on this phone is that yes it's nice no doubt on my part but i think there was some poor planning design and function wise or maybe because design wise fuctions had to be limited." **** 'fish'

---"first the phone, it's a nice looking phone but that's where it pretty much stops, motorola is very behind on the features they offer for phones and the display has been the same for the past atleast 10 years since i had my first motorola, the phones that offer the best features for wallpaper, color schemes is lg, there phone features are awesome." **** 'nice'

---'once we got the phones i called back to check and yes the person from cingular had done everything as asked, i also checked from the phone itself as you can go to "my account" from the main menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.as far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, i can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, i don\'t recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and cingular "in my area" puts out a great signal.my wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away "with no roaming charges" btw our last cell phone service "alltel" would have been roaming within 20 miles.anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in "speaker phone" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, i put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a free call "mobile to mobile".we sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.she used the phone as her alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.i\'ve had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it "needs" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, so i\'m easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that\'s with a lot of fiddling around with it because it\'s new and 1-2 hours talk time.some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke.' **** 'average'
---':)the bad:first, after 33 days the black razr started making this very high pitched noise if i just opened the phone and put it to my ear.' **** 'first'
---'the battery gets excellent life (usually 2-4 days, depending on how much i use it).' **** 'much'
