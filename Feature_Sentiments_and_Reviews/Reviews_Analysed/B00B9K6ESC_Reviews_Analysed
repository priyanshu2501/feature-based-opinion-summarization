---')the screen of the kyocera event was "slightly" sharper, which i noticed with tiny words in online pictures, but otherwise, when reading text at websites, the screens of both phones are "not the highest res" and slightly contrasty at websites (which means whites a little too white, and slightly short on the details in shadow areas, which isn\'t the case with my galaxy player 5.0, just for another point of comparison).the optimus elite is also thinner, (0.38 inches) with same h and w as the kyocera event.' **** 'sharper'
