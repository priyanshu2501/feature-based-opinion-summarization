__________('light',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"low light camera performance is top-notch.the bad: verizon's typically blazing speeds stumbled on the lumia 928, and call quality sounded harsher than nokia's usual standard." **** 'low'
---"the xenon flash gives better low light performance and the 8.7 mp pureview camera takes superbly sharp and vibrant photos.pros-impressive photos, including better technology for low light / indoors-wireless charging-verizon's impressive coverage-4g-high-performance mic and speaker-free turn-by-turn navigation, very easy to use maps, virtual reality, and location-based apps-still challenges you to be good at maximizing your battery time but less challenging than previous versions-windows 8 os, which is intuitive and easy to use, an impressive performer and highly customizable, and a hell of a lot better looking than the iphone (os upgrade is expected later this year)-renders websites beautifullycons-although i have found all of the apps i use regularly, a more app-driven person might not find everything they'd like on the marketplacethis phone is gorgeous." **** 'low'

---"(good)phone--------------------* phone history doesn't show call duration & no good apps to add feature* 2 click process to answer phone, a little annoying* randomly seems to drop between 1x (cell signal) and 3g and lte within a few feet (in a weaker signal area)camera/video--------------------* greens appear saturated (in daylight)* low light camera white balance is off sometimes." **** 'low'
---'video, photo, low light, high light, all good.' **** 'good'
---"(you can get quad core cpus on high end android phones, but i've found windows phone 8 seems to be a much faster os-it feels fast even on the low end nokia 521, much less this 928, and i doubt much software actually takes advantage of more than 2 cores on mobile devices like this)  it's also got a great camera-apparently the best low light performance of any phone." **** 'low'

Positive Reviews:

---"it's fast, the battery life is good, it seems very durable (mine has already been dropped a few times still functions properly) and it it's very easy to figure out and get accustomed to after using other phones.the only downfall i can find is the fact that the windows store is lagging behind apple and droid." **** 'good'
---"sound quality is excellent through the headphone jack and rhapsody and pandora work well and sound great.battery life is very good, i can get through a day without a charge first smartphone i've had that can do that.if you get one make sure to get a case as the phone by itself is slick and skinny and easily dropped." **** 'good'
