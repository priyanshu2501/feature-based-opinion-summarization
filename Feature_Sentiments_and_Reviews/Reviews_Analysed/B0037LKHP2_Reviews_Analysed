---"he had too much trouble opening his previous 'clam shell' phone.the only real problem with this phone is that the numbers get pressed when he places it in his top shirt pocket behind his glass case and pen holder.the other problem is that he doesn't have great sensitivity in his fingertips and when he presses  speed dial, he just gets the one number, not the speed dial saved number.he works through these, and it is easier for him to answer the phone which is what he wanted.he cannot work the slide lock on the side because of finger problem.plus, he has large fingers.i hope they can come up with a phone made for larger hands/fingers." **** 'other'
