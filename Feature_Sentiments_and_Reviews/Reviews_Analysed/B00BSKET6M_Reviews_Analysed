Negative Reviews:

---'one of the main features people like blackberry, ie security, is the same reason they/you may not want this personal information in the cloud: if your email is hacked, so is your personal contact information and that of family, friends, etc.unlike blackberry exchange server, the active sync capability bbry offers for this synchronization to outlook.com is not encrypted.so, if you rely on two way sync with outlook to manage/organize your life, setup/keep appointments, etc, you may want to wait until bbry\'s bb link software has two way sync, which is "coming".otherwise the phone is great, but it was a real shocker to get this home and find out i could not sync with outlook via usb as i\'ve done for years.' **** 'main'
---"first off, it comes with no manual and what is available doesn't cover many of the features so you have to spend time on the internet and with support to figure out how some of the really important things work." **** 'available'
---'but this is only the first release of the software (actually there has been one minor upgrade already) and i am sure that features will be added just as they have been for the iphone, and games and other third party software will be developed as the number of z10s out there increases.if you are all about content consumption (movies, music, etc) and are wedded to itunes and the apple brand, then the reasons for you to switch are few, but if your work demands that the major function for your phone (other than actually being a phone, which the z10 seems to perform admirably at) is as a mobile e-mail machine, then you owe it to yourself and to your productivity to seriously look at the z10.' **** 'sure'
---'no other company had as big a library when they started.-camera (time shift feature is a blast to play with)- look and feel (feels solid and perfect fit in your hands)-hdmi connection-ill add more as i discover/remember all the new features!cons- this phone cant be abused like some other phones, screen isnt as strong to survive severe drops on concrete.- i would have preferred a larger battery-as an att customer i preferred the white z10, but was okay with the black one.overall it is worth giving a fair shot.' **** 'new'

__________('mail',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"i predict the other os's will eventually have an equivalent of the hub, because it's just so much better than having to: open an app for texting; open an app for calls; open an app for gmail; open an app for yahoo mail; open an app for work email; open an app for whatsapp; open an app to check voicemails; open an app for notifications; etc." **** 'open'

__________('operating',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'this is much better than paying $200 for z10 with poor selection of apps, close to isolated ecosystem, face with a lot of bugs since it has the new operating system and softwares, dismal apps developers support etc.' **** 'new'
---'user interface - the completely new operating system blackberry 10 is what really sets this phone apart from the others.' **** 'new'
---"i am not sure where to start but i guess i will talk about the operating system first, all of my other blackberry's were very productive and professional, this operating system is worse than android, first of all there are no more categories for your contacts and you how to know everyone's first name." **** 'sure'

Negative Reviews:

---"one more thing, this blackberry phone same as the old one is difficult to dispose cause you can't sell them or give it to your kids they will not accept it and you will end up throwing wasting monies, this may holds true with this z10, no apps developers support, no big hi tech company backing/supporting it most likely this new operating system will be gone just like the others." **** 'new'
---'i have never found it so simple to keep my emails, texts, facebook messages and instant chats organized.having used ios and sndroid, i can honestly say that i believe blackberry is on to something with their new operating system.' **** 'new'
---"i am not sure where to start but i guess i will talk about the operating system first, all of my other blackberry's were very productive and professional, this operating system is worse than android, first of all there are no more categories for your contacts and you how to know everyone's first name." **** 'professional'
---"i am also posting this same review for both the z10 and the z30, since it applies to both.first and foremost, and i wish blackberry made everyone aware of this:the old blackberry is indeed dead!i emphasize this because most people don't realize this new os is not in any way an *upgrade* to the old blackberrys; it is a completely new operating system, with far more in common with android, ios and windows phone than the old blackberry." **** 'new'
---"5 months later it's been discounted, selling price on ebay are right at the 400-460 range(i sold mines) so lets start, the good with this phone is the battery and it's a simple operating system." **** 'simple'
