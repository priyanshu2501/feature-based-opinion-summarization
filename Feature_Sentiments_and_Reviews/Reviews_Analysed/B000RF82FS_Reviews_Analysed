__________('case',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'number two, the very beautiful case scratches the screen badly.' **** 'beautiful'
---"okay, so, i've had this phone for a little less than a week now, but this is what i know alreadythis phone is great, not too big, not too complicatedbut its not an iphone, if your looking for something with lots of apps and what not this is not itpersonally, i like it cause all i need to do is text and call, sometimes check email, but not much elseits true the case does scratch the phone, i read that, but used the case anyway, i just got a little scratch on the back that you can only really see in the light, but i stopped using the case to prevent further damage, no big deal, i still use it too hold other thingsthe first phone i was sent didn't work at all, i read the instructions carefully before using it, followed everything they said, and it kept freezing at the start up, which elsewhere i've seen other people have the same problemno worry though, amazon just sent me a new one and i returned mine with little hassle of my ownbtw on a side note, make sure you do read the instructions carefully because i was surprised to see that this phone needs to be charged fully before initially turning it on, unlike with any other phone ive hadif you've never used an unlocked phone before make sure you call your service provider to get things set up once you have the phone, like picture mail, internet etc.alsoi kind of like the fact that its based around t9 and not a keyboard for textingit makes it easier to do without looking and everythingi got used to using this phone really quick and really couldn't imagine carrying around something as big as the iphoneplus, its cheaper..... i think?anywaygood phone, no problems with the second one sent to me,but no different in functions really from any other phone" **** 'light'
