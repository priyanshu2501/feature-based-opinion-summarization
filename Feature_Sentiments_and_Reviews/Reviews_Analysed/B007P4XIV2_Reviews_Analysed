__________('price',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"yes, the price is nice and mine was a 'freebie' owing to a 2 year contract renewal so i suppose i got what i paid for... nothing.issues are numerous: wifi that malfunctions intermittently, near constant freezing, inability to make phone calls due to faulty dialer operations, short battery life, etc." **** 'mine'

Negative Reviews:

Positive Reviews:

---'yesterday was the first time an in-store verizon service person actually offered to order me a new phone....but guess what???' **** 'first'
---'armed with a 1.2 ghz dual-core snapdragon processor and 1 gb of ram, you should have nothing to worry about for app compatibility, at least for a long time.' **** 'long'
---'but when it is not, it takes a long time to get other data connection.' **** 'long'
---"as a matter of fact, the phone's resident voicemail app would not connect with my vzw voicemail; instead, i searched the google play store for a decently rated voicemail app and downloaded it -- and only then could i access voicemail.in my opinion, email was not any better: the email setup process was seemingly more time consuming and less friendly than with other phones." **** 'less'
---'the loading time from when you turn it on is pretty decent.' **** 'decent'
---"so think about doing that, it still beats getting a larger battery for twice the price.call quality: not sure if this is me only but the quality does seem a little odd at times, i've had people tell me that they sometimes have a hard time hearing me and i do have to say that on speaker there is a little cracking on the voice." **** 'hard'
---"plus with it being free at that time (with 2 year renewal), i couldn't pass it up.i should have.within the first couple months, the battery started to die rather quickly." **** 'free'

Positive Reviews:

---'if you do anything other than leave it in standby for calls, you will need a pocket full of batteries.speaking of which, if you are playing a game, or watching a movie, or doing anything you might have bought a smartphone for, the battery draws down so quickly it gets hot.the os is set up to avoid using data if at all possible, therefore if there is an open wireless network anywhere in the area, it will jump on it like a horny dog, regardless of the quality of the data connection.' **** 'possible'
---'but when it is not, it takes a long time to get other data connection.' **** 'other'
---'if you have lots of time to sit at a charger, like slow 4g and want your personal data to be taken up by a phone, get this phone.' **** 'personal'
