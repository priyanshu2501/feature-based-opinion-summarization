Positive Reviews:

---"the weight of the nexus 5 is evenly distributed across the device, leaving you with a 5&#34; smartphone that feels light for it's size, but not flimsy or as cheaply made as you might fear at the price point.call quality 3.8/5starting out, in the first week after i got my device, there were phone call quality issues, but whether these went away because of software updates, or because my issues had nothing to do with the phone itself, i am unsure." **** 'light'
---'the phone is very fast, slim, feels good on ones hand and the best thing is its affordable.' **** 'good'
