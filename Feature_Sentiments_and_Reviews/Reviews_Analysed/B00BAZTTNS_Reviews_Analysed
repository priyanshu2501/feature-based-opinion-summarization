---"it lives up to the praise and then some, all at a moderate price and performance wise, rivals phones costing 2x as much.i was going to buy a s-3 when the s-4 came out in anticipation of the cost of the phone being more reasonable, but bought the spirit while the $70.00 rebate was offered and i'm glad i did as i like the spirit better than the s-3the only real negative is the camera - it does great outdoors in natural light, but can be a bit grainy indoors.for the $200.00 savings, i can live with a 5mp camera vs. and 8mp camera, and if i want to take good pics, i have a 16mp nikon coolpix camera that cost me $100.00 for a refurbished model and it takes fantastic pics.either way, you can't go wrong with this phone and i can't recommend it highly enough.good luck and enjoy." **** 'glad'
