---"they forgot this feature on a few screens, and hitting a vertical screen when you have been doing things horizontally is a little annoying.- the touch screen keyboard is slightly smaller and more challenging to text with than the iphone.i don't use data, so i can't comment on those features.all in all, i am happy with my purchase." **** 'touch'
---"i was really anxious to upgrade to a touch screen phone, but i didn't want to renew my contract with verizon." **** 'touch'
---"its not an iphone but it come very close.pros:- touch screen is good- no data plan- very thin- good features- camera is nice too.cons:- can't update firmware- touch screen can freeze once in a while but not for more than about 10 seconds- still need to use data to get some cool features" **** 'touch'
---'it does take a little getting used to if you have never used a touch screen.' **** 'touch'
---"i, on the other hand, am not entirely sold on this phone (especially its length, which is longer than the lg chocolate) so i'm holding out replacing my lg chocolate until, in my opinion, a suitable (basic phone not requiring a data plan) replacement comes along.update: 7/9/12: for the past few months, the phone has been acting up with the touch screen failing to respond." **** 'touch'
---'many times i have typed entire sentences on the touch screen, the phone does nothing, and then 10 seconds later like 3 letters appear.' **** 'touch'
---'the touch screen can become a little unresponsive if you have a lot of memory build up, (messages and photos etc.)' **** 'unresponsive'
---"it requires a couple button pushes to bring it back.- it takes about 30 seconds for the phone to go to sleep and i haven't found the short cut to disengage the touch screen." **** 'touch'
---"another issue i have is it doesn't always sense that you've touch the screen at all." **** 'touch'
---'my last reason for not liking the touch screen is that the individual number/letter buttons are too small.' **** 'touch'
---'touch screen is just as bad as the previous two phones.' **** 'bad'
---"it's been mentioned quite a bit in other reviews about how unresponsive, slow, and uncooperative the touch screen has been, but i cannot stress enough to some of you who think they can live with this that it is a deal breaker." **** 'touch'
