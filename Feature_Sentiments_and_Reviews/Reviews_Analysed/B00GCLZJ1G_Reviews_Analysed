Positive Reviews:

---'the processor is super fast, graphics are crystal clear, the spark means i have had amazing speed away from the wifi in my house.the 2 issues we have had with it are as follows:- when turning off the screen, about half the time it takes at least 15 seconds to get the screen to turn back on.- the battery is pretty small compared to similar style phones, but since there is no &#34;bloatware&#34; i have hardly noticed a difference from previous battery sizes to this one.' **** 'super'
