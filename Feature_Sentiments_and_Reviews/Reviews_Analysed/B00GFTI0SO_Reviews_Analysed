---'the extensive verizon network this phone uses is imperative for anyone who travels a lot or lives in a rural area.it is unfortunate it will not work in neighboring canada or mexico, or overseas, but for most domestic use this phone and the plans to go with it are a good value.sound quality is good and clear, i am a little deaf and the speaker phone is very loud.unlike older tracfones, where you would lose all your contacts with each phone change, android will automatically import and update all your contacts, as long as you keep your google account current.the voice dialing feature will access your google contacts list, but i have found it to not be very accurate.accessing google and yahoo e-mail are flawless with their dedicated apps.google calendar syncs with the included calendar app.texts are conversation style, enabling you to scroll through and read an entire thread.i have successfully posted pictures to facebook with it, but i have not tried sending picture texts.you have 3 "unit buckets" with android vs. the old one bucket for voice/data/text, and you can easily keep track of each with the tracfone usage app you\'ll download from google play.' **** 'google'

Positive Reviews:

---"this lg android phone for $20 is i think the best deal out there.pair it with magicjack app which i think is the best app out there and it is a money saving machine.the magicjack app gives you free calls wherever you have wifi.whenever i make a call the phone gives you the option to use magicjack or tracfone dialer which helps you save tracfone minutes.magicjack app is free or you can pay $10 a year for your own u.s. phone number.i use magicjack plus for $30/year($2.50/month) for my home phone service and have the app set to use my home phone number.when someone calls me at home it also rings my cell if i am connected to wifi.because of this app, i only need minimal tracfone minutes for $7 a month for rare occasions when i don't have access to wifi.so i get home phone service and cell phone service for $10 a month.i also use the mj app on my kindle fire hd.however, there are ways you could pay even less combining mj app with this phone:1)if you used the free version of the mj app with this phone and used it only on wifi,you would get phone service for free.with the free version,you could get a phone number that has an asterisk at the beginning and end of the number.2)for $10 a year(.84 cents/month)you can choose your own u.s. number.if you have wifi at home,work and almost anywhere in your area like i do,you would get phone service for .84 cents a month.lol.3)pair the mj app $10/year plan with minimal tracfone minutes for $7/month(buy the $20 tracfone card every 3 months) which will cost you $8/month combined.this would be good for people who use a mobile phone only and don't have or want to use a cordless or corded home phone.as of now,i prefer the tracfone/magicjack plus/magicjack app combo for $10/month because i still like to use a regular cordless phone at home to give the cell phone a rest and the tracfone minutes are useful for the rare occasions when i don't have access to wifi.this lg phone is a great deal and gets even better once you use the combination described above." **** 'free'

Positive Reviews:

---"i had 2200 minutes, now i have 2200 talk/2200 texts/2200 data, so that's really cool.setting up the wifi was easy as well and i was able to port all my contacts from my old phone with bluetooth." **** 'easy'
---"it wasn't all bad - the wifi worked well and kept me from using the data allowance - which was fortunate as i never found a verizon signal to get on the net." **** 'bad'
---'also, the keyboard, when in landscape mode, is just really nice overall.- this phone has a set of switches in your notification drawer to toggle vibrate, wifi, bluetooth, gps and your 3g connection.' **** 'vibrate'

---"this lg android phone for $20 is i think the best deal out there.pair it with magicjack app which i think is the best app out there and it is a money saving machine.the magicjack app gives you free calls wherever you have wifi.whenever i make a call the phone gives you the option to use magicjack or tracfone dialer which helps you save tracfone minutes.magicjack app is free or you can pay $10 a year for your own u.s. phone number.i use magicjack plus for $30/year($2.50/month) for my home phone service and have the app set to use my home phone number.when someone calls me at home it also rings my cell if i am connected to wifi.because of this app, i only need minimal tracfone minutes for $7 a month for rare occasions when i don't have access to wifi.so i get home phone service and cell phone service for $10 a month.i also use the mj app on my kindle fire hd.however, there are ways you could pay even less combining mj app with this phone:1)if you used the free version of the mj app with this phone and used it only on wifi,you would get phone service for free.with the free version,you could get a phone number that has an asterisk at the beginning and end of the number.2)for $10 a year(.84 cents/month)you can choose your own u.s. number.if you have wifi at home,work and almost anywhere in your area like i do,you would get phone service for .84 cents a month.lol.3)pair the mj app $10/year plan with minimal tracfone minutes for $7/month(buy the $20 tracfone card every 3 months) which will cost you $8/month combined.this would be good for people who use a mobile phone only and don't have or want to use a cordless or corded home phone.as of now,i prefer the tracfone/magicjack plus/magicjack app combo for $10/month because i still like to use a regular cordless phone at home to give the cell phone a rest and the tracfone minutes are useful for the rare occasions when i don't have access to wifi.this lg phone is a great deal and gets even better once you use the combination described above." **** 'best'

---'great phone, once i got it up & running, but set-up was an all day affair.it seems basic enough, a few short steps, but the tracfone website was the mostfrustrating experience i\'ve had in a long time.either you\'d get timed out, or brought back to the home page, over & over again.i\'m not sure if the site, itself, was under maintenance, but it would not let mefollow the given instructions.finally, i managed to call the number, and that also hung up on me several times(it was automated).as a last resort, i got a live person from the menu option, and bought air time viacredit card and they set me up.i didn\'t know what my number was until i searched on the actual phone.at that point, i still couldn\'t seem to make calls.by accident, i set up my voicemail, which activated the final step of the phone, andnow all works perfectly.but that website...that was an endless circle of frustration.but the good news is the phone itself is miles beyond my old vm querty keyboard phone.it is fast, touch screen, very inuitive, and the calls are crystal clear via verizon.well worth the earlier set-up hassle!adding contacts, web browsing, making calls, texting...it\'s all laid out in easy to digest format.this is not an iphone with retina display and ten million apps at your fingertips.this is a great basic smart phone or beginner smart phone.i\'m not a big phone guy, so the phone & plan are perfection for folks like myself.and the money you will save on both the phone and the plan, will be substantial.easily the most cost effective bang for your buck, in the cell phone realm.update: have been using this a few days now, and i really like it quite a bit.if you are going from an iphone to this android, of course, this phone willnot appeal to you.but if you are going from a slow, pay-lo, candy bar/text phone, this lg willbe a revelation.at 24.95 this phone cost 20.00 less than my old "slow, glitchy" texting vm phone.i\'m impressed that i got such a great deal on this, via amazon.' **** 'touch'
---"so, if you're on safelink or simply find you don't like the touch screen interface, think twice before switching.whether you like this phone or not will totally depend on what you want to use it for." **** 'touch'
