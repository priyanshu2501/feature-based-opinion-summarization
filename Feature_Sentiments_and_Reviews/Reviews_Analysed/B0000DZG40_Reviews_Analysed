---'in order to delete messages telling you you have a voice mail message you have to press 6 buttons to get to delete--way too much effort for something done so regularly.there are other things which i cannot remember at the moment, but to sum it up--the visually attractive qualities are ruined in the first week the first time you drop it; the sound quality is poor; you cannot hear your call waiting beep; and your text messages are all caps--with so many options out there, save yourself the annoyance!!!!!!' **** 'poor'
