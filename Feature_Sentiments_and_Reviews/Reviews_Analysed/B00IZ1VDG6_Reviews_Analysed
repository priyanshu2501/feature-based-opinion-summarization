__________('power', 'button')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"The Cons: Transferring data from my old cell phone was a pain and failed once causing lots of duplicates, the phone is kind of long with the speakers, there's no menu button so finding anything in the phone is hard, transferring stuff from internal to external drive is a pain- I couldn't find any folders so had to download an app, when texts couldn't send there was no resend option they just hung out there until it tried again on its own, the default home screen is useless, the app screens don't wrap around, all the symbols at the top of the screen can't be accessed in one touch or swipe, if LTE didn't work it wouldn't go to 3g, the music player doesn't have an equalizer, the battery can't be removed and with lots of apps going was below 10% before noon, the power button is on top, the volume buttons require too much pressure, you need a special key (included) to remove the micro sd card, no swipe for texting, and the 4mp only camera." **** 'top'

Negative Reviews:

---"It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons." **** 'top'
