Positive Reviews:

---"As someone who avoids texting and the multiple keystrokes that are usually involved, the Z431's QWERTY keyboard makes texting easy and fast." **** 'easy'
---'The keyboard that I find easy to use in spite of the tiny keys.' **** 'easy'
---"The interface just seems more awkward, the keyboard is even worse (the Huawei's wasn't great, but I think it was a bit better than this), and my mother always complains she can't hear me very well on it (but that could be her--I have used other cheap phones and she always says she can't hear me well)." **** 'worse'
