Positive Reviews:

---"either way even with all this phones great features i simply cannot take the hiss and i will be returning it to amazon wireless.other negatives:gps takes about 20 to 25 minutes to pick up a signal (picks up faster the second time you turn it on but seems to need to be turned on every three or four days to have the faster signal acquisition) i.e the first time you use it 20 to 25 minutes, second time a minute, don't use it for a week then 20 to 25 minutes again.constantly dropping calls seems like every other time i talk to my wife on the phone it drops a call either on her end or mine, and we live in a verizon 4g area (orlando)every 4th or 5th time we talk to each other there is a huge amount of static on the line and you have to hang up and call back.text message field is configured wrong so the swype keyboard does not work right when sending text messages.has a huge problem staying connected to 4g indoors and even when it does connect you are looking at closer to 500k down of actual speed, not 5mb to 10mb theoretical.all in all i was extremely disappointed with this phone coming over from the evo." **** 'actual'

---"i haven't had a chance to assess the battery life yet, but hopefully it isn't too bad." **** 'bad'
---"the verizon agent assured me that there was universal 4g coverage in my state.the internal memory is choked with apps that i dont need and can't seem to remove.battery life is ridiculously short." **** 'short'
---"unless you are simultaneously streaming your hd soap opera over 4g, syncing 30 apps, playing angry birds, and listening to music through your bluetooth headphones, you'll probably find that the battery life is satisfactory." **** 'satisfactory'

Negative Reviews:

---'if the battery life is equally bad, i will just go back to my iphone and wait until apple implements lte 4g in the future.the verizon lte 4g is light years ahead of the competition, unfortunately the only phone that supports it - the thunderbolt, is sad joke as its network flagship.' **** 'bad'

---')conclusion:in my opinion if you are reading this review at the end of 2011 and looking for the latest and greatest, you might wanna save yourself some money or a contract and get a clean used htc thunderbolt (came out about six months ago) which not only matches iphone4s and samasung s2 in terms of power and functionality but surpasses both when considering the value (and verizon 4g).' **** 'clean'

---"not sure if the battery makers will solve this issue but i'm buying an extended battery today and expect that will improve things.it has a handy flip out stand which allows the phone to be stood up on its left side for viewing, but for some unknown reason htc also put the micro usb charger slot on the left side so renders the kickstand unusable while the phone is charging." **** 'extended'
