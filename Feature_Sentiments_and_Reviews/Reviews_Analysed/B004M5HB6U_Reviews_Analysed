---'The thing that I didnt like about the thunderbolt at first was ultimately the battery; and what was dissapointing to me, was how Verizon\'s customer care reps wasnt knowledgeable about how you could download an app which is called "4G SWITCH" OR "LTEOnOff" that would let you choose if you would like ur phone to operate off of 4g or 3g.' **** 'first'
---'So, I exchanged it for the Thunderbolt and I am so glad I did.' **** 'glad'

---'That, folks, is really the only flaw I have noticed other than the very obvious battery life issue.' **** 'obvious'
