Positive Reviews:

---"it was fine at the beginning, pretty nice device, a little heavy but looks goodbut i think there's an issue with this model becausestopped working suddenly,.. the screen went black, and sometimes white... the point is, i dont recommed this model at all" **** 'black'
---"maybe i'll update later.to sum it all up, if a bigger phone isn't you, you can't handle the sucky battery life, a ton of settings get confusing or a rough fit for the charging and headphone jacks are really that much of a turnoff, might wanna look else where.but, if you are a bit of a geek, love messing with settings, get excited about little things such as an amazingly bright screen, animated wallpapers, 1gb of ram, 1.5ghz processor, almost unlimited apps, a top notch wi-fi card, a great on-screen keyboard, being able to easily detach the back plate from the rest of the phone by this handy little button on the bottom, then this phone is absolutely for you.although i've been out of the mobile world for a bit, my tech experience is there." **** 'bright'
---"it's fast, the screen is beautiful and vibrant, the camera works very well, and i really like the metal construction of it- it looks fantastic and feels quite a bit more solid than a typical glass-on-plastic candy bar phone." **** 'beautiful'
