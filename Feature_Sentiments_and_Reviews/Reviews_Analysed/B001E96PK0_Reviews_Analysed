Positive Reviews:

---"i've had a few times when i needed to reset the phone - but it's not often and because i'm running third party applications, i can't really complain - again i'm happy with the phones performance.reset: to reset the phone you really need to remove the battery for a second because there's no convenient switch.wi-fi: there's a great little switch on the side of the phone for starting and stoping wi-fi which i find very convenient instead of hunting through the menus.gps: it's really fast and works well - it'll find 6 or 7 satellites in a minute or two... much faster than a nokia n95 that i previously owned.silent switch: there's a physical switch for when you go into meetings and you want the phone to be silent - i love this switch and use it a lot." **** 'little'

---'pros: design, phone/speaker phone volume, windows mobile 6.1 pro, standby battery life, screen saver clock, silent switchcons: battery life for my real world usage (emails checked every 15 mins., talk about 1 hour a day, 3g web browsing, stuck in vibrate mode often - after using the switch to switch back to ringing mode, bluetooth stereo transfer problems (have to repair with the jabra speaker bluetooth everytime to get streo music transferred, otherwise plays on the treo loudspeaker), gets slow as time passes for some reason (the beachball keeps spinning longer opening the same programs).' **** 'slow'

---'i had a really difficult time trying to figure out if the stuttering was caused by the headset or the phone only to discover, for some reason, if you shut off the screen while media player is going, tracks will start stuttering, which basically meant, i had to leave it pluggged in with the screen on to listen to music...the final issue i had, was with email.' **** 'difficult'
---"palm refuses to replace the phone and refuses to create a fix for it as it is a registry issue from what i have read on the palm forums.-once the phone goes on roaming, i practically  have to reset it to get it off roaming.-i consistently use the comm manager to turn off and on wireless/cellular due to flying all the time and i often have to go through the motions two or three times to get it to actually execute.-the battery is ok for a smart phone.-the on board internet browser gets the job done for me.-the call quality has been fine and it rarely drops calls on me.-all my messaging capabilities work ok, though i can't figure out how to timestamp incoming texts, annoying.i'd not recommend this phone to others due to my issues with it." **** 'due'

---"the device had a lot of menus and was difficult to navigate (kind of like all of the other windows software i've ever used) but i read a review on the device that mentioned installation of spb mobile shell and that has helped tremendously; it should be the first piece of software that you install!" **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

__________('palm', 'treo', 'pro')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"the wifi is fast, the design is great, many people complain about the small keyboard, but i find it perfect, maybe my nails and slim fingers help, but i really have no complaints, it is a phone not a keyboard after all.windows mobile on the other hand, has it`s advantages but in my opinion is way too slow, i`m an engineer used to speed and efficiency and i really miss the fast performance of palm os, besides, it takes to many steps to do something you could easily perform in a couple of clicks before.it's taking my mind more time to create the habits to perform basic activities, since they take so many steps, to send a message used to take me 30 seconds, and now 60 or 90, i know 30 seconds may not be much, but it is double what it used to take me, and frankly to much for me.it has given me some small glitches like no rings for a couple of hours, and i have to soft reset it to get the sound back, but nothing major or frequent.if you get the spb mobile shell software you will miss the palm os less, and get more productivity, this program is definitely a must.i strongly recommend to see the reviews in treonauts to choose software and freeware such as skype, skyfire, opera, etc to enhance the experience.i'm happy with the phone, but i surely wish it was a new version of palm os instead of winmo." **** 'less'

Negative Reviews:

---'fast, slim, gps work perfect, i add it a 32 gb micro sd kingston memory and attached via bluetooth to my car stereo and i have a lot of music to hear while driving, i prefer this than an iphone, also i think it\'s better than "treo pre" (not windows os)--- if you don\'t want to have an internet contract, there are multiple programs that download maps from google and you can navigate offline ;) ------ reception everywhere, and easy to manage contacts with outlook, sync by bluetooth' **** 'better'
