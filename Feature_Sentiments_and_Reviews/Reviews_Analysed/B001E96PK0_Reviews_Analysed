---"Overall, I'm quite fond of my Treo Pro and I am very happy with it as a replacement for my 750." **** 'overall'
---'Fast, slim, GPS work perfect, I add it a 32 GB micro SD kingston memory and attached via BlueTooth to my car stereo and I have a lot of Music to hear while driving, I prefer this than an Iphone, Also I think it\'s better than "Treo PRE" (not windows OS)--- If you don\'t want to have an Internet contract, there are multiple programs that download Maps from Google and you can navigate offline ;) ------ Reception everywhere, and easy to manage contacts with Outlook, sync by bluetooth' **** 'better'
---'The only downside I can think of is that the Treo Pro is not compatible with most bluetooth headsets and you will have to spend lots of money to find just the right one that works with this phone.' **** 'compatible'
