__________('micro', 'sd', 'card')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'But the bottom line is: you should be able to play all your iTunes music on this phone, if you choose to do so (and are willing to purchase a large enough micro-SD card).' **** 'willing'
---'(If you did this you would likely need to buy a bigger SD card than the included 2GB card.' **** 'bigger'

__________('android', 'market')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"DroidWall is an easy to use app that allows you to choose which apps that can have WiFi or 3G access (basically, just allow every thing with the green and white android symbol and anything that you use that you think would need internet access, such as the web browser, Google market, etc, to access at least WiFi, then only give the apps that you would like to be able access anywhere 3G access) this way you can reduce data usage on the 3G network and increase your phone's security.- I would also highly recommend the free Norton Utilities app to any android user, it is very useful for managing and monitoring your phone.- The free 3G watchdog app is another handy app that monitors your 3G data usage.- Lately there have been numerous android antivirus apps popping up on the android market, but from my research it seems that there is a big mix of opinions as to whether you need an antivirus on your android or not." **** 'white'
---'I hear alot about T-mobile prepaid and it appears that they have an unlimited plan that inludes web for smartphones and they have some good android phones.' **** 'good'
---'This is my first android phone and the internet works as good as a PC in my opinion.' **** 'first'
---'This phone has a great screen, good battery life, and nice Android install (with all the usual AT&T; crapware, of course).' **** 'nice'
---'Overall, the LG Thrive is a very nice budget/starter Android smartphone and provides very good value for its price.' **** 'nice'
---'I am happy with my Android phone which I am using without a data plan right now.' **** 'happy'
---'***App suggestions***- You can get apps like free JuiceDefender that are suppose to increase your phones battery life by automatically turning your 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS off when you are not using them, I do not know for sure how much it is extending my phone\'s battery life but JuiceDefender doesn\'t seem to inhibit the functioning of any of my other apps, so I recommend it.- I also recommend the MX Video Player because it is the only free Android video player that I could find that would completely get rid of the black bars around any movie, you just set it in zoom mode and move two fingers apart vertically on the screen to zoom in any amount that you want, to cut out the black bars (it is add supported, but the adds are unobtrusive).- If you have a rooted phone then I highly recommend installing the free DroidWall app, as the reviewer "Jason C" suggested.' **** 'free'

---'I love electronics in general, so I was extremely excited when I was able to get this essentially unlocked Android phone for only $150.' **** 'able'
---'This is my first android phone and it kicks ass.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'I suppose letting people who always want the newest phone out getting locked down into a contract would force companies to be more competitive and create a better market for the consumer, which would be balanced playing field and not conducive to enormous profit.' **** 'better'
---"Based on two days of ownership, I'd say the positive reviews are basically true: this is a nicely designed, easy to use, low-cost Android phone that works well with AT&T's pay-as-you-go program... as long as don't need Web access and text messaging, or are willing to pay $20 to $40 a month for them in addition to your per-minute fees for calls." **** 'easy'
---'* Like any other Android phone, you can upgrade the memory by buying a larger microSD card.' **** 'other'

---'After that you will be able to install apps from any source.' **** 'able'
---"If there are no problems, the device will reboot (note that the reboot itself can take like 10 minutes due to cache wipe)- Make sure the Superuser app is install and working(go to Settings/ Applications/ Manage applications/ you should see Superuser somewhere in the Running list)- Optional: Install BusyBox from Market (I personally prefer the stericsson installer)(this is a utility used by some other apps so you don't really need it until you get an app that uses it)- Optional: Uninstall GingerBreak, you don't need it on your phone anymoreYour LG Thrive should now be rooted." **** 'other'
---"This does not fully solve the problem though because most of the apps still must have some data on the phone's memory and certain apps cannot be transferred, like most At&t; and Google apps and live wallpapers(I suggest uninstalling apps, games, and especially live wallpapers that you are using at the moment, you can always re-download them from Google or Amazon markets by pressing the menu button on your phone and selecting my apps while you are at one of the markets)." **** 'certain'

---'I have noticed that some free apps from Amazon are incompatible with this phone.' **** 'free'
---'True, you can move some apps to SD, but even then, these apps will still eat up a certain amount of onboard memory.' **** 'true'
---'I read another review where the guy said the graphics can get sluggish with games like Angry Birds and I can confirm that as well, but it\'s not all the time and it\'s just a game... LOL :)  Other Apps I\'ve downloaded have worked fine with little to no trouble (none of the "force closes" I\'ve read about with other phones/Apps)...' **** 'other'

---"While it does have some annoyances (e. g. copy/paste which should be much improved on later versions of Android) and doesn't quite have as many apps as iOS, I find that all the major apps I use are available and the ones that don't at least have alternatives." **** 'major'

---'The key is to preferentially install apps that can move to the SD card, and to remove any apps that you do not use regularly.' **** 'key'
---'The major feature of this update is the fact that it gives you the ability to gain access to the Amazon app store (and presumably other apps stores) without having to use any hidden menus or root your phone.' **** 'other'
