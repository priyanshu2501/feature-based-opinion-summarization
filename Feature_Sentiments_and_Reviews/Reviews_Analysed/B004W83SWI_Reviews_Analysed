---'after that you will be able to install apps from any source.' **** 'able'
---"if there are no problems, the device will reboot (note that the reboot itself can take like 10 minutes due to cache wipe)- make sure the superuser app is install and working(go to settings/ applications/ manage applications/ you should see superuser somewhere in the running list)- optional: install busybox from market (i personally prefer the stericsson installer)(this is a utility used by some other apps so you don't really need it until you get an app that uses it)- optional: uninstall gingerbreak, you don't need it on your phone anymoreyour lg thrive should now be rooted." **** 'other'
---"this does not fully solve the problem though because most of the apps still must have some data on the phone's memory and certain apps cannot be transferred, like most at&t; and google apps and live wallpapers(i suggest uninstalling apps, games, and especially live wallpapers that you are using at the moment, you can always re-download them from google or amazon markets by pressing the menu button on your phone and selecting my apps while you are at one of the markets)." **** 'certain'
---'***app suggestions***- you can get apps like free juicedefender that are suppose to increase your phones battery life by automatically turning your 3g, wifi, bluetooth and gps off when you are not using them, i do not know for sure how much it is extending my phone\'s battery life but juicedefender doesn\'t seem to inhibit the functioning of any of my other apps, so i recommend it.- i also recommend the mx video player because it is the only free android video player that i could find that would completely get rid of the black bars around any movie, you just set it in zoom mode and move two fingers apart vertically on the screen to zoom in any amount that you want, to cut out the black bars (it is add supported, but the adds are unobtrusive).- if you have a rooted phone then i highly recommend installing the free droidwall app, as the reviewer "jason c" suggested.' **** 'other'
