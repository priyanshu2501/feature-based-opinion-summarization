---'after all, the vast majority of those apps are likely rarely used.' **** 'likely'
---"lack of a dedicated ebook reader is a smaller drawback since there are other apps available, but ibook stands high and tall and i won't trade anything for it.wp8 is not bad and has the potential to be a good product, but it is lagging behind and charges a premium!" **** 'available'
---'here maps and navigation are built in, making the need for google apps relatively irrelevant.' **** 'irrelevant'
---'all metro apps are really cool.this is future.....apple and samsung beware.' **** 'future'
---'most of major apps are there, if not directly then by 3rd party.' **** 'major'
---'the iphones have a cool factor and are always a great toy with its apps and music and whatnot.' **** 'music'
---"but with the resources of microsoft, we will probably see those apps available soon.i think the benefits of a free worldwide gps that doesn't need data connection, and an slr like camera outweigh the shortcomings." **** 'available'

Negative Reviews:

---'it has it good point far as taking really good pictures, but far as calls and watching video/music on the web it low on volume ; plus you can not go back on a video you left off it just start over or you just have to keep pressing the fast forward key which is annoying, that i cant just go back to touch the spot i left off at.' **** 'good'
---'i always try not to get myself mucked up too deep into one eco-system, but i do let ms handle all my pim info and it has worked to my advantage for quite some time.if you love taking good pictures and you are not tied down to one eco-system, this phone is for you without a doubt.enjoy!' **** 'good'
