---'i\'ve had this phone for about 8 hours and i think i know it well enough to review it so here goes.-these phones are not new but they\'re not broken or scratched or have anything wrong with them.-it ships in its original sidekick lx box with the sticker cut open so you know its not new, inside is:-wall charger.-usb cable.-headphones.-protective pouch.-micro sd card.-battery.-start up guide.-reference cd.-and the phone obviously.-the color "orchid" is a very deep plum, sometimes it even looks like a dark brown.-you can\'t change ringtones, or at least i haven\'t been able to figure it out without using mms.-you can\'t recieve picture messages or "mms" messages because it gives you an error code saying to "check mms account to ensure the apn is correct" even after you change the apn to an at&t; setting it still will not work.-you can however change and download new themes using your usb cable, so i thought that was exciting.being in 2011 and only two days away from 2012, i felt like i had to "dumb down" my phone experience using this phone.' **** 'original'
