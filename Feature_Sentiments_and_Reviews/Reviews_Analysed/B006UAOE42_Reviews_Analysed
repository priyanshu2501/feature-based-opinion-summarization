Negative Reviews:

---'after installing that on the charger\'s power cord, the tab charged quickly.the other "gotcha" is that for a long time windows user, android can be hard to figure out, and touch screen operations can be much different from mouse and keyboard.' **** 'long'
---"however, it didn't become widely available for some time and i waited and waited....and waited." **** 'available'

Negative Reviews:

---'i don\'t get the same feeling watching video on the ipad, the nook, or on my home pc with a 24" screen.the camera is also pretty decent, although it seems that it needs to use the flash in order to get sharp pictures.now, there are numerous frustrating downsides.' **** 'decent'
---'lol one might say that the ipad mini is much newer and is therefore a better choice, however it is basically an ipad 2 (almost 2 years old) shrunken down with a better camera and a new dock connector.the fact that its screen is better than the ipad mini (widescreen with 1280x800 pixels), and has expandable storage (not to mention it makes phone calls/sms if you need that!)' **** 'better'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'most apps i have used on this device work perfect, but with this screen resolution you will find the font to be somewhat small on apps not made for the 1280x800 screens, but i don\'t mind that as the screen and colors are amazing, and until you hold this in your hand its hard to put in writing just how beautiful it really is.the speed of this tablet is amazing, i have yet to find any lag, i seen some people complain about samsungs touchwiz as being slow and buggy, i found that out on my galaxy s4g, but that is not a problem as i use go launcher ex, a free launcher on the android market, and by far imo the best launcher there is, so do not let touchwiz stop you from getting this tab.i fly several times a year and the size of this tablet for travel is perfect and the weight is so light it is not a worry about having too much in your carry on.movies and videos play very well with the stock video player and there are several on the market you can use if you find videos that do not work on the stock player.i spent the $50 on the samsung case and it was money well spent, this tablet is so thin and weighs so little, it can be hard to hold without this case to add some girth to it and not much weight and also, its nice to have the protection you get with this.the screen has a coating that really does keep fingerprints and smudges at bay, with my 7" tab you pretty much needed to carry a cloth around to wipe down the screen after minimal use.' **** 'small'
---"it is a little difficult, you have to run a program called odin, set the device in usb debug mode, startup the device in usb load mode by powering it on and holding volume down, load the clockworkmod in place of the default recovery, unplug the usb, load a cyanogenmod .zip file and google apps (gapps) .zip file onto a micro-sd card, start up clockworkmod by starting the device while holding volume up, select the cyanogenmod .zip file and load it, and then the gapps file --it's a lot of work and took me about 3 hours to figure out.but once you load jelly bean on this tablet, it is a significant improvement over the stock samsung rom." **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---"i'm really grateful to the other reviewers here for all the help they gave - those reviews gave me the courage to get this without trying it first!i'm still learning about android, and all the various apps that are available, but so far, i haven't found a single android app this tablet won't run." **** 'available'

__________('video',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"my old 7.0, though still a nice tablet, appears noticably fuzzier after viewing the 7.7.  i would say the resolution on the 7.7 is as good if not better than the resolution on the ipad 2.  i haven't seen the new ipad, so can't comment on that, but i'm sure the video comparions between the galaxy tab and the new ipad (3?, 2s?)" **** 'sure'

---"i'm not going to go in-depth but yes, the screen is beautiful, it's plenty powerful even if it's not the newest quad-core, video and wifi quality are excellent." **** 'newest'

---'maybe someday they can bump the resolution of the amoled screen, but even comparing this to screens with much higher resolution, the amoled just blows the others away (and yes, this includes high end ips screens).' **** 'higher'
---"due to high resolution of the screen it is possible to use the keyboard in horizonal orientation and still see enough of the screen to make it usable (something i could not do well in my tests of galaxy 7.0)===============================size:i consider the tablet's size its second most important to me feature." **** 'due'
