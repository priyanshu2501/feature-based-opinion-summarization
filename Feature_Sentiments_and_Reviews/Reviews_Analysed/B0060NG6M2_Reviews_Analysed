---'needless to say by phone replacement number 5 i was so fed up i was counting the months like a prison inmate counting down the last days to freedom.when the time drew near for me to be able to tell verizon they could take that phone and shove it (it was the motorola rival by the way) i had already begun doing research.' **** 'last'
---"with respect to complaints about battery life, it's not that hard to get 2 days, at least, with a little effort." **** 'hard'
---"bought the lg optimus slider after my prior lg rumor2 succumbed to water damage.this essentially is my first smartphone since switching from a basic feature phone.overall experience with the optimus slider is mostly positive.biggest positive for me:since the optimus slider was released  before prices for the beyond talk plans increased i get to keep my old bt plan at its original price $25.phone experience:first time  with android it was an easy transition got used it within the first day.call quality is quite good far better than lg rumor2 i can hear people clearly.speaker quality is very clear making my  mp3's bearable to hear even in noisy places.battery life was abysmal the first few days." **** 'first'
---'for the first few days with the oem batteries i only got around 4 hours of use per battery at the time.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---"this phone arrived within three days, but i'm not able to activate it." **** 'able'
