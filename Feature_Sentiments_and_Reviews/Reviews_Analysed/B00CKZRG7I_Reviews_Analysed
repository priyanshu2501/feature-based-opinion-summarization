---'you can install games and they will work perfectly with the 2 cores that come inside, try to no install games that are over 100mbs without a microsd to use as external disk.about the ram: some apps will eat all the ram and sometimes you will see the phone going a little &#34;slow&#34; this happen in most phones at this price because too many apps running at the same time will eat all the memory, anyways who need 20 apps open at the same time?about the 3g/data: you need to be very careful with automatic sync with google it wiill eat your monthly plan very fast, i recommend to turn it off and do it manually, go to settings &#62; accounts (bbm, google, twitter, etc..) &#62; select google &#62; click your account &#62; and start unselecting all of them.phone is perfect for daily uses of social media, taking photos and videos, i recommend a good microsd card.bye.' **** 'open'
