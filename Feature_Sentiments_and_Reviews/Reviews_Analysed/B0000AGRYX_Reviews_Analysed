Negative Reviews:

---"battery goes for about 4 days (obviously depending on usage time) and charges fast (about 2 hrs i guess)11. this phone is not as big as you might think, it is relatively small, but has a bigger screen than many cell phones (that's why it looked big to me on the web) and joystick is very convenient." **** 'convenient'

__________('direct', 'sunlight')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"for all those who have had t68i, you will love t610 and for those who are new to the sony ericsson world here is a detailed review for you.i'll speak more from a usability point of view rather than feature listing - you can find features on various websites.let's start with pros:- its small, light and easy to carry (even in your shirt pocket)- keys well lit / well spaced (important for small phones)- large screen and pretty clear (some people complain about reading under direct sunlight - its not convenient under sun but is usable)- with phones entering the pda/camera/mp3 player market and having too many features, se has done a good job of organizing all its features under 12 icons." **** 'direct'
---'this is the most annoying feature if you download a lot or like to take pictures.- screen is a little hard to read in direct sunlight (i have not found this much of a problem)- camera not particularly good (i moved from a nokia 3650 which had a far better camera) and seems to encode jpegs rather inefficiently.- no xhtml browser, if that matters to you.- prone to getting fingerprints all over it.' **** 'direct'
---"i can't read the screen in direct sunlight." **** 'direct'
---"besides, the menu interface is top-notch, better than the motorolas, samsungs, lgs, and nokias i've used before.other features in which this phone needs some catching up are:1. the 65 thousand color display is very nice, but it is unreadable in direct sunlight." **** 'direct'

Negative Reviews:

---"the bad things i have found are that it is often difficult to see the display in direct sunlight, and the menus are sometimes slower that i'd want them to be." **** 'direct'
---'it is very difficult to read in direct sunlight.' **** 'difficult'
---'it is very difficult to read in direct sunlight.' **** 'direct'

---'the sound quality is so-so.' **** 'so-so'
---"i have 3 phones:nokia 6610, motorola v60g and sony ericsson t-610.even with a broken antenna the v60g gives me better reception than the t 610. i have t-mobile on all three phones, so the t 610's poor reception couldn't be because of network problems.the camera quality is pretty poor and i sorely miss the loudspeaker option that is present in the 6610.i feel that the next phone that i'll buy is going to be a motorola; their phones are very intuitive to use as compared to nokia/sony ericcson.also, before opting for t-mobile - please please please - check the network connectivity in your locality." **** 'poor'
---'the only thing that bothers me is that i have not been able to get a holder for the phone and i dont like it when it stays in my jean pocket, coz i always assume that its gonna break.i also got the jabra headset for 20 bucks.... amazing deal and a must buy accessory for this phone, specially konwing that it gets dirty too quickly.the photo quality is not bad for a cellphone.overall i am very pleased with the phone.' **** 'bad'

---"silent) for a defined period of time, so when i am out of the meeting the phone goes back to the original setting without me having to rememberc) any form of handsfree - everything is optionald) screen saver kicks in even if there are missed calls - so instead of being able to notice missed calls just by looking at the phone, one actually needs to activate the phone by pressing on somethinge) screen is very sensitive to any type of touch - no wonder sony provide a cleaning cloth - another thing to carry with you at all times!f) a silly button on the top-right hand side of the phone: when clicked by mistake it automatically connects to the internet - always lock the keypad!g) do not by mistake push the &quot;mouse&quot; to the left as it also connects automatically to the internet - always lock the keypad!h) no fmthings that this phone has and nokia didn't:i) camera - although the quality is very poor compared to say moto v600 - i do not think i will use that feature muchii) bluetooth - although that means nothing unless you have the optional bluetooth headset, usb dongle or another bluetooth phone aroundiii) bigger and more hi-tech icon-based screen - although cannot be seen from any angle other than directly in front - it would have also helped had it been a touch screen!all in all i should have stayed with the nokia - but i was too hasty and also ordered the headset so there is no way back now." **** 'poor'

Negative Reviews:

---'if pairing with t-mobile service, be aware that they do not know how to make their service work properly with these phones.there are actually a number of other minor issues with this phone, including intermittent bluetooth connectivity, a microphone that picks up every last bit of ambient sound and is almost impossible to use in a car, the fact that the battery wears out quickly even in "lock" mode because hitting any key activates the backlight...but all these things i could overlook, were it not for the two major issues above.' **** 'aware'

Positive Reviews:

---'i really am enjoying this phone.the good: very small size, long talk time, long standby time, color screen that is easy to see, great reception (using t-moblie in downtown seattle), bluetooth wireless (unexpectedly useful), sexy design, loud and diverse ringers, and useful software features.the bad: the camera has horrible resolution and is practically useless, software requires a lot of unnecessary button clicks to operate.' **** 'easy'

Negative Reviews:

---'the screen is bright and the colors are very rich for a cell phone.' **** 'bright'
---"let me get right to the point...i really like this phone.pros: can't beat the price (as of 12/21/03 it's $-100 with the free jabra bt headset), it's very nice looking, great screen and colors, very user friendly and intuitive (for example all calls are stored in one list, instead of three sperate for missed, dialed, and recieved), bluetooth ease-of-use is best on the se products, the jabra headseat rocks, i really like the sound of the ringtones and ascending ring, the pc sync is great (never again will i have to hand input my contacts), the sound quality of the phone is a+, the recent firmware significantly improved the phone's ability to recieve and hold signal (even with 0-2 bars, my phone hold signal much better than my old at&amp;t s56, i rarley have break-up and have yet to drop a call).cons:  the black part of the phone really attracks fingerprints (i am constantly wiping it off), the signal meter is very hyperactive (goes from 0-3 bars like it was skiing moguls / yet calls still remain connected), there are no talk and end buttons (the phone uses &quot;soft keys&quot;), camera is no so good (i don't care, for me it's a gimic, but some might), no belt clip included (some phones throw them in, and it's nice when they do), small buttons are a litte hard to get used to (i don't mind, i had the t68i and this phone and once you get used to them you won't even pay attention to it, but if i let a pal make a call i get some complaints)." **** 'nice'

---"the color screen is nice, until you try and use it in sunlight - simply put, you can't!" **** 'nice'
---'at the time, its features were jampacked and very modern - with the bluetooth, embedded phone, sleek design, sharp little color screen, etc.' **** 'little'
---"it's small enough to fit anywhere and the color screen is great." **** 'small'
---"now, let me state the flaws so i can get to the good stuff.weaknesses:1) the screen becomes washed out in sunlight2) without a case, the screen gets many scratches (but they are only visible when the screen is off or you're in sunlight)3) the menu's can be a bit more complicated than necessary4) no dedicated pickup/hangup buttons5) rarely the phone will freeze and has to be restarted6) the camera's not so hot, but hey, its a phone.in my mind, these flaws are fairly minor, so i will get to the good stuff.strengths:1) 65,000 color screen that will automatically go off when not in use2) bluetooth and infrared connectivity3) camera, picture messaging, photo-callerid4) tons of cool accessories (but they're pretty expensive)5) small and lightweight, yet sturdy6) voice memos, record a phonecall7) cool design8) calendar/alarm that can alert you even when you've turned off the phone." **** 'visible'

---"for all those who have had t68i, you will love t610 and for those who are new to the sony ericsson world here is a detailed review for you.i'll speak more from a usability point of view rather than feature listing - you can find features on various websites.let's start with pros:- its small, light and easy to carry (even in your shirt pocket)- keys well lit / well spaced (important for small phones)- large screen and pretty clear (some people complain about reading under direct sunlight - its not convenient under sun but is usable)- with phones entering the pda/camera/mp3 player market and having too many features, se has done a good job of organizing all its features under 12 icons." **** 'new'
