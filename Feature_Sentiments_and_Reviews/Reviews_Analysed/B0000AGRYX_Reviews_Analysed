__________('direct', 'sunlight')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"Let's start with Pros:- Its small, light and easy to carry (even in your shirt pocket)- Keys well lit / well spaced (important for small phones)- Large screen and pretty clear (some people complain about reading under direct sunlight - its not convenient under sun but is usable)- With phones entering the PDA/Camera/MP3 player market and having too many features, SE has done a good job of organizing all its features under 12 icons." **** 'direct'
---'This is the most annoying feature if you download a lot or like to take pictures.- Screen is a little hard to read in direct sunlight (I have not found this much of a problem)- Camera not particularly good (I moved from a Nokia 3650 which had a far better camera) and seems to encode JPEGs rather inefficiently.- No XHTML browser, if that matters to you.- Prone to getting fingerprints all over it.' **** 'direct'
