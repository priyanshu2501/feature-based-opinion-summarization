Positive Reviews:

---"finally, the os in itself looks rather unrefined, and the black screen of the menu screen is reminiscent of some horrible non smart, non touch phones of years past.at&t; coverage - it must be noted that at&t; has below average coverage and voice quality, enough so that they are pushing wifi to combat the network congestion caused by iphone users.button placement - a small, but frustratingly notable flaw in the phone's design." **** 'black'
---'the problem is with the touch screen.' **** 'touch'
---'att is sending a replacement but it sounds like the touch screen failing is a common problem.' **** 'touch'
---'the touch screen is very responsive, the phone is actually very fast, and the screen is crystal clear.' **** 'responsive'
---'the touch screen is very responsive, the phone is actually very fast, and the screen is crystal clear.' **** 'clear'
---'no threaded sms + missing letters + repeating letters + a super slow input reaction = lots of time correcting your text messages.4) input on the touch screen can lag a lot, causing your device to hold up, process the request, and then finally send it 5 seconds later.' **** 'touch'
---"i've only had this phone for a day, but here are my impressions so far:pros:- the touch screen is responsive, and i find it easier to use than an iphone.- the qwerty keyboard is nice for entering contacts' names, but i would agree with other reviewers that the buttons slow you down a bit for texts." **** 'responsive'
---'it senses light and turns off the touch screen when the phone is by your ear.' **** 'touch'
---"as far as i can tell, there's no way to speed dial people by dialing a single number.- the lock button (which unlocks and locks the touch screen) is poorly designed." **** 'touch'

---'the only issue i have had with this phone is that the touch screen takes a bit of getting used to, but i have fairly large hands and was able to master it in about a day.this is a great all around phone for text messaging and making phone calls.' **** 'touch'
---"the 3 megapixel camera takes great photos and mp3's sound exceptionally well on this phone.several of my friends are drooling over my awesome new phone.attention:since purchasing this phone i have the touch screen on three different ones completely stop working on me." **** 'touch'
---'texting is my favorite on this phone with touch screen pad or the full keyboard.' **** 'touch'
---'i hate this phone because its touch screen is very unreliable, because a charge only lasts about three days even without use, because the phone turns off after a very short time, and turning it back on usually takes several tries!' **** 'touch'
---'i have an apple ipod touch, so i know what a good screen response is like.' **** 'good'
---'the samsung impression is no where close!one of the things besides a touch screen that i wanted in my new cell phone was a slide out physical keyboard, and there i am reasonably happy.' **** 'touch'
---'i sometimes have to touch the screen 3-4 times in order to make the function work (even after calibrating and re-calibrating the touch mechanism).lastly, and most annoyingly, the space bar key button is awful.' **** 'touch'

Negative Reviews:

---"google map is not designed to work with touch screen, so it's useless." **** 'touch'
---'it senses light and turns off the touch screen when the phone is by your ear.' **** 'light'
---'i hate this phone because its touch screen is very unreliable, because a charge only lasts about three days even without use, because the phone turns off after a very short time, and turning it back on usually takes several tries!' **** 'unreliable'
---"i haven't found any way to adjust the time out on the automatic lock, which is what it really needs, as well as a more reliable lock/unlock button.most frustrating, though, is how the touch screen sometimes works and often doesn't -- if you touch an icon, it may or may not activate." **** 'touch'
---"now, i don't really need internet access from my phone or a lot of text messaging; i just wanted to have the touch screen, the slide out keyboard, and the microsoft apps, particularly their onenote, and maybe occasional web access, that i could pay for on a per mb used basis." **** 'touch'
---"so in terms of service just get the bare minimum, and if you want the other features just add it later, which is better than getting stuck with services that you don't need or want later.i must say this, this phone has the better resistive touch screen in the market, and switching between landscape and portrait is also the fastest i have seen yet." **** 'better'
---'"press 7 to delete this voicemail message"), but the phone doesn\'t display that numeric keypad on the touch screen.' **** 'touch'
---'the touch screen is not responsive and its constantly freezing.' **** 'responsive'
---'that way you dont have to worry about scratching the touch screen.' **** 'touch'
---"it is extremely frustrating trying to get a problem solved with someone that is struggling with english and hopefully companies will figure this out.applications - i specifically got this phone because i didn't want a data plan, but wanted a touch screen phone with a qwerty keyboard." **** 'touch'
