Positive Reviews:

---'PROS-The phone is very light-the portrait qwerty keyboard layout, and just type functionality give very quick access to apps, contacts, web searches-application card metaphor works very intuitively for switching, arranging, dismissing apps-ringer switch is very convenient-Synergy on webos lets you pull and consolidate information from many accounts into the phone (yahoo, gmail, exchange)-notifications are unintrusiveCONS-so far battery life is poor, it barely makes the day with moderate use-the back of the phone gets hot after some minutes web browsing-the App Catalog is not available in some countries, based on the country where you activate your phone, not even for free apps-The phone is disabled when you connect it as a usb drive to the computer' **** 'poor'

Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---'The gist of it (sorry please google around for details) is:1. install an HP driver called Novacom on your PC (so it can talk to the phone), 2. download HP software called Activation-Bypass Tool on your PC, 3. boot the phone into "recovery mode", 4. run Activation-Bypass Tool on PC while your phone is connected in recovery mode, to reboot the phone into developer mode (this is where you\'ll temporalily lose your call/text ability which you\'ll regain later), 5. run a third party application called WebOS Quick Install on PC to install two patches on the phone, i. e. "Enable Profile Creation - Activation Bypassed" and "Show FirstUse App", 6. reboot the phone, 7. set up wifi on the phone, which is going to be necessary in the next step, 8. run "First Use" app that was intalled on your phone (see step 5.)' **** 'recovery'

Positive Reviews:

---'It seems to port contacts and such even if the names do not match.- Only problem I had was if you had a Palm on your PC at one time, that name is still there and probably the contact data also and DTA can pick the wrong data, so be sure to have the PALM account name the same as the Palm Desktop software, it is easy to rename of make a new one.-If you set the wrong Contacts, do a Palm phone reset and set up the phone again using the same Palme account because you now have one from the first go around.-Be patient with all software and updates it is slow but once done things are speedy.' **** 'wrong'
