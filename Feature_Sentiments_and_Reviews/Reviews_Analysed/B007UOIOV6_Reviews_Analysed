__________('onboard', 'storage')__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---'likewise, i considered waiting until the u.s. version of the galaxy 3 was released, but i just couldn\'t wait any longer and wasn\'t convinced it would be a better phone for me than the one x in any case.i read a lot of reviews comparing the one x to the samsung galaxy 3.  bottom line:  it is probably a draw for the most part, with most professional reviewers prefering the case design of the one x, but noting the onboard storage advantage of the g3 with its removable micro sd card.more onboard storage would be nice, but there is no need for tons of onboard storage if you embrace "the cloud."' **** 'nice'

---"i had heard good things about both companies, though at the time samsung was not quite as big of a player in the market as htc and due to the shortage of one x's (this was during apple's let's sue everyone campaign) i decided on the one x. i thought why not get a phone that was not as available to the public as the s3 and when i first got the phone and started playing with it/setting it up i fell in love.i was not off put by the fact that i needed a computer to change/set up the way the phone looked, in fact i thought it made the profile look crisper and better and more personalized." **** 'good'
