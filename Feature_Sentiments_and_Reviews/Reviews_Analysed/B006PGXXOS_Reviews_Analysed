---'this phone is the worst phone ever i only had it for less than 5 months and it was turning off by its self it would freeze a lot and when i called manufacture they would tell me to restart it or to take the battery off but that just made it worst i would recommend not to buy it' **** 'less'
---'it was a great phone for the first 9 months.' **** 'first'
---'so, after about two months of remaining as optimistic as i could, i started to explore the return policies of a)the manufacturer and b)the service provider and c)the retailer.' **** 'optimistic'

Negative Reviews:

---"i didn't purchase the phone from amazon, but i am returning to amazon to buy another phone because this one failed.this phone was great for the first two months." **** 'first'
---'or just freezing up and becoming unresponsive to the point the battery has to be removed....  every day you try to use it is another problem.it was a great phone for the first 6 months or so, then it started having minor issues, and now at 1 year its garbage.i would also really look at another provider than these sprint pre-paid deals.' **** 'first'
---"battery life was what you would expect from and android phone, nothing amazing.after 1 year i started having problems with the phone, locking up, freezing, shutting off in the middle of phone calls, not getting calls at all[people would say i called you but you didn't answer, nor did it register a missed call],not receiving text for hours sometimes days after they were sent to me.certain apps are not compatible with this phone ie scramble with friends.so after having the phone for 18-19 months i'm tired of all the problems and looking for a new phone.i like the boost's pricing but not its phone selection,they are owned by sprint, i don't get it.guess i'll stick to a major brand next time,but those have problems also just more accessories.." **** 'tired'
