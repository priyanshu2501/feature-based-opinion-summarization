---"!yes, although the price is amazing, you are only going to be able to use it as a phone.however if you are going to text (or anything) you better have the smallest fingers ever.fingernails will not work as the screen is set to work with only skin contact.i'm not sure why anyone would deal with this size screen.i've come to the realization that we will never find a good phone with wifi and speed for under $200.00!please save your time and money please.this phone is for baby fingers and eyes only!what a waste of time.happy phone finding!" **** 'able'
---'is the best price-quality phone with android.. excellente, screen is very soft, little but for that price is logic.es el mejor telefono android con la relacion precio calidad.' **** 'little'
