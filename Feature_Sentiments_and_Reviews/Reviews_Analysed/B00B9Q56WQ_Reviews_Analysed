---'very good phone part (nokia knows the job), excellent battery life, beautiful (small) screen, support 64gb micro card.windows phone is a good system but apps are limited and some cross platforms apps (laptop, ios, androd) are not present (yet ?)' **** 'good'
---'i have simultaneously used maps, whatsapp, music, internet applications and it has worked just fine.the networking of the phone is very good too, with the internet working smoothly and messages being delivered instantly.the phone has not hung once in my experience, and while it has undergone a bit of lag, just press the side button, and the whole system will revitalise without losing any running tasks or apps.battery: with 1350 mah worth of battery, you would think it is quite less, but that is not so.as i mentioned earlier, the whole system is integrated tightly and this means that the battery life is more than good for the performance it delivers.i mainly listen to music constantly, surf the internet periodically, use whatsapp every 10 minutes and use maps for directions.' **** 'whole'
