---"but i when received the smartphone i found out that it was an international version of the n95-8gb (the 3g is cdma 2100)the best way to figure out if it's a us version (n95-8gb nam or n95-4) is to get the rm version of the cell." **** 'international'
---'for instance, the n82, which features a full xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support north american 3g bands, just like the n95-1 and n95-2).update dec 1, 2008: the n95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: then85and then96.' **** 'available'

Positive Reviews:

---'voice navigation is free for 6 months, then it\'s $10/mo thereafter if you wish to keep it.it also has voice commands, so i can simply say "joe" or whatever, and it will dial "joe" for me.there\'s a small learning curve for the texting and url entry, etc, using a t-9 keypad as opposed to a qwerty keyboard, but it\'s actually not that bad if this may be what\'s keeping you on the fence.' **** 'free'
