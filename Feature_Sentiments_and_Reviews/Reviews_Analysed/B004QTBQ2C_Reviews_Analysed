---'i would rate it 5/5 for the features it has.i had a samsung star 3g phone and this one is a pretty big upgrade for that phone..:-)with the star not giving me even a single problem for the past 2 years, i wanted to stick with the samsung, and this device has pretty decent reviews ans so wanted to go for it.this phone is really good in- display- touch sensitiveness- music play back- weight- height- the build is solid, no creaking sounds...- 1080p video recording kicks ass...really good recording even in night time.- photos are awesomely clear...- speaker is pretty decent compared to other phones in the market now.- on and on and on...battery life seems to be ok...there are many applications running in the backgound even if we stop them.' **** 'decent'
---"i wont be going into the technical reviews because they are well written and explained by my pals here in other reviews.i read the reviews here before buying this piece of beauty.i owned a apple iphone 4 and believe me it blows away the iphone 4.i know its not possible to compare a 2 high end smartphones one with latest technology and the other with a year old,but after all we tend to coz iphone 4 is the much successful smartphone of 2010.i can predict that even galaxy s ii will compete head on with iphone 5 and still win.coming to the next part is there are two versions of unlocked samsung galaxy s ii to be sold out on amazon.the one with no international warranty is majorly produced in china.you can see it on the black box.but hey don't worry about it they are all authenticated cellphones having imei numbers ( i was in the same dilemma when i got this beauty after shelling out my hard earned money)i later confirmed it from my vendor and samsung.it has a chilean firmware which comes with an american charger in it.so don't panic.second one, you would get is an uk version with uk firmware and is probably made in korea.so currently regarding unlocked ones majority of people are getting one of these two versions.they are one and the same.people say the battery life is poor.even i agree with it but how can we expect that a ferrari should be able to give 35 mpg on road.same applies of here.there is one more solution to overcome the battery problem.you can update your firmware to 2.3.4 it resolves a lot of issues which are even unknown to you including the battery life.enjoy your samsung galaxy s ii's" **** 'technical'
