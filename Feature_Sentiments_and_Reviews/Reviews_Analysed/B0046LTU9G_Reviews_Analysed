Positive Reviews:

---'the lack of auto focus simply means i can\'t take close-ups of documents or displays.ms office documents can be created and edited (.doc, .xls and .ppt) while waiting at airport terminals and on airplanes.now i don\'t need to carry my laptop around for meetings and presentations.just an hdmi cable to connect to lcd tvs or projectors.e7 can connect to external hdd...i have not yet been able to get it to work with my hdds, but that may be due to my hdd partitioning scheme and filesystems.nokia looks to be at a crossroads of the mobile mindshare.if nokia wants to improve the user experience or ux...they should seriously take a look at the moap ux used on japanese symbian smartphones.in 2007, a long time ago in mobile mindspace, these japanese phones with moap ux wrapped around the symbian os, had rich media, dvb-tv and push email.the nokia e7 shows that symbian can still beat any phone os available today with features like:- networking- multitasking- efficient cpu and memory usage- longer battery life- multiple form factors (touch screen, qwerty keyboard, t9 keyboard, or any combination)there\'s a lot of bs going on about symbian being 10 yrs old technology.technically, most "modern" mobile operating systems are repackaged with graphical interfaces wrapped around "old" operating systems.very few companies can claim to come up with a "new technology" mobile phone operating system...a lot of the "innovation" is the user interface.under the hood, symbian is a solid tried and tested truly mobile phone os kernel.if symbian is 10 yrs old then...- android is even older (with the 20 yr old linux kernel)- apple iphone ios is 25 yrs old (ios contains the unix mach/bsd kernel)- wp7 is 15 yrs old (wp7 contains the windows ce kernel)besides putting in great graphics, animations and eye candy for the gui...nokia certainly need to take better care with doing a "task analysis" of the user interaction on each phone model (since nokia have an abundance of phone models that are most likely designed, built and shipped by different groups within the company).this should help bring about consistency with the key press and screen taps for the same operation on different phone models.' **** 'modern'
---'too bad, the operating system will not be renewed by nokia, even though it is slower than windows operating system.' **** 'bad'
---'even after upgrading to nokia belle operating system, it started freezing that same day.' **** 'belle'
---',  i checked android phones  which was much more flexible with their operating system , but had  some really crappy phones .' **** 'flexible'
---'and the new operating  system anna is very smooth as well .so here is the list :fast , good on battery , build right ( aluminum body ) and beautifully made ?' **** 'new'
