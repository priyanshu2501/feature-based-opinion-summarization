Negative Reviews:

---'Maybe Nokia is getting better... no more words can be told... try with Nokia I can not say anymore.' **** 'better'

Now, time to be short and sweet and name just a few ups and downs:- The fact that Nokia managed to squeeze the keyboard and screen into a mobile device whose hardware (as usual) is impeccable and truly some of the best Nokia's ever put together (which is saying something, trust me), and whose form factor is as fresh, slim, and eye-catching as a concept phone that's come out 6 months too early, is just unheard of in today's somewhat mundane mobile marketplace." **** 'best'
