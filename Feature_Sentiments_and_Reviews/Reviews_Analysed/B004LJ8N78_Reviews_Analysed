---"i returned it today and will probably be getting the optimus slider here on amazon instead, since the keyboard looks similar to the one on the rumor.if possible, i'd recommend giving the keyboard on this a live tryout before buying, but if you are reasonably comfortable with such things, i'd say this is a pretty good deal, especially at the price i paid." **** 'similar'

---"),they are useless to me.sprint also limits your 3g use but with the wi-fi and so many places to log on i have not had the problems i had with the rumor touch.also the lack of a keyboard isn't as bad as i though because of the speech to text function.this works great for me and i hardly use the touch screen keyboard at all.for 25 dollars a month for 300 minutes (which i never use up) you can't beat this phone.i think virgin mobile will do away with this plan soon (like the minute plan) but they will let those who have it keep it until they switch plans or give up their phone." **** 'bad'

---"it's too bad that the sprint network, on which vm rides, doesn't have more coverage in the northwest.3g data coverage is spotty and doesn't always work indoors, but when it works, it works well.first, second and third-tier customer support are of questionable value." **** 'bad'
---"the setup has worked so well that we were able to cancel our landline phone service, saving more than the cost of one of our cell phone plans.if you are in an area with good sprint coverage, the lg optimus v on virgin's prepaid plan makes a formidable competitor to landline telephone service while offering all the advantages of using a modern smartphone." **** 'good'

---"!and for your information i commute every day 25 miles into the heart of chicago from the suburbs and never lose any reception along the way, because ever since sprint took over virgin mobile, vm's service is phenomenal and always stays true to its word about bringing the best coverage for the cheapest value (and do not get fooled by the word cheap - the phone with this $25 plan will kick any carrier out of the water).i've always had att and iphone from 2g to 3g and then 3gs but eventually got fed up with paying at least $80 per month and being on a contract that i tried this prepaid plan out and i have loved it ever since.if you are even thinking about getting prepaid let me tell you virgin mobile gives you the best bang for your buck, has the best, most polite customer service (called them five times for different things and was assisted in the best way), and uses sprint's 3g service and its towers therefore has the best coverage especially anywhere in the chicago land area including milwaukee and even up to madison - yes never lost signal once while traveling even that far away.best part is that you can import your prior number so you don't have to alert everyone on your contact list that you have a new phone and yes there is even better news the app bump can shift all your contacts from either another android phone or iphone to this phone in a matter of seconds so no need to input all those phone numbers.i am truly loving this service and this phone and as a graduate student let me tell you this is truly the best thing that's ever happened to me...and to think i actually spent 4 grand over two and half years paying att for unreliable service.even if you are thinking about this go out to your nearest target or radio shack and try it out both give you 30-90 days for return policy and if you don't like it return it for the full refund and for the pre-paid card also.though you will like it please let everyone know how your experience was so we can let people know what the best product is so other phone companies should compete and give us consumers better pricing!!!!!" **** 'best'

Positive Reviews:

---'i still pay $25 a month for unlimited texting and 300 minutes with data which is really impressive compared to other plans.' **** 'impressive'
---"that best 150.00 i ever spent,i had a vm blackberry curve before the v that phone sucked,but never once did it fail to make a call or drop a call,the data was slow but it always worked,back in march i decided to give the optimus v a shot,and so glad i did,it was great once i learned how android worked,you add up a separate gps mp3 player and phone and it is much more then 150.00 now add in the fact for 43.00 dollars a month you get 1200 minutes talk unlimted txt ad data no caps or throttling i have noticed and it's a no brainer,the only reason i can see someone complaining is the coverge in their area is not good,or the purchased a dud,as for me this phone has never failed me.other then a data issue for about 5 days,that has been fixed in my area,but the phone and text worked right thru it.i recommend anyone who wants a smartphone and does not want to sign a contract and spend 100 or more a month, give it a shot." **** 'slow'

Negative Reviews:

---"this makes speeds faster and saves data so you won't reach your limit on you 'unlimited' data plan, although it does drain battery life.talk and text seems to be good for the most part, with good reception in most areas you would expect your phone to work.battery life is a little disappointing." **** 'good'

---"!i got the lowest $25 beyond talk plan which has all the (unlimited) data needs i have and the 300 minutes of talk time is more than what i need.there are so many free apps in the marketplace that i found very useful.the phone is very responsive.i'm using it mainly for e-mail, calendar, alarm clock, notes, shopping list, product bar code reader, watching videos, web browsing, listening to radio, calculator, annoying call blocking, weather, news and even games like angry birds for my kids just to name the few useful apps that i found in the droid market place.now, i spend less time checking e-mails with my pc.i spend those times plaing with my kids instead.it connects to my home wireless network but i don't really have to since my plan includes unlimited 3g access.activition was smooth too, considering i was switching from a vm pay-as-you-go talk-only plan to a beyond-talk plan.the vm rep was helpful and was able to transfer my remaining balance from the old plan to the new plan and port my phone number in no time.in summary,con - quick battery discharge, though you can disable unecessary apps and/or use apps like juicedefender that can do that for youpro - the phone has got a everything i need, happy with the service from vmanyway, i am sure there are much better smart phones out there.but for the price of the device and the no-contract beyond-talk plan from vm, it's a win-win for me.good luck shopping for your next smart phone, i hope you'll find one the suits you." **** 'free'

---"!and for your information i commute every day 25 miles into the heart of chicago from the suburbs and never lose any reception along the way, because ever since sprint took over virgin mobile, vm's service is phenomenal and always stays true to its word about bringing the best coverage for the cheapest value (and do not get fooled by the word cheap - the phone with this $25 plan will kick any carrier out of the water).i've always had att and iphone from 2g to 3g and then 3gs but eventually got fed up with paying at least $80 per month and being on a contract that i tried this prepaid plan out and i have loved it ever since.if you are even thinking about getting prepaid let me tell you virgin mobile gives you the best bang for your buck, has the best, most polite customer service (called them five times for different things and was assisted in the best way), and uses sprint's 3g service and its towers therefore has the best coverage especially anywhere in the chicago land area including milwaukee and even up to madison - yes never lost signal once while traveling even that far away.best part is that you can import your prior number so you don't have to alert everyone on your contact list that you have a new phone and yes there is even better news the app bump can shift all your contacts from either another android phone or iphone to this phone in a matter of seconds so no need to input all those phone numbers.i am truly loving this service and this phone and as a graduate student let me tell you this is truly the best thing that's ever happened to me...and to think i actually spent 4 grand over two and half years paying att for unreliable service.even if you are thinking about this go out to your nearest target or radio shack and try it out both give you 30-90 days for return policy and if you don't like it return it for the full refund and for the pre-paid card also.though you will like it please let everyone know how your experience was so we can let people know what the best product is so other phone companies should compete and give us consumers better pricing!!!!!" **** 'give'
---"but i'm getting used to the touch keyboard and i'm finding it not be that bad.the camera takes great pics (for a camera phone, i think it's on the better end).using an app called 'android booster' that lets me turn off the 3g service when i don't need it, i am able to get as much as 6 days out of a single charge." **** 'able'
