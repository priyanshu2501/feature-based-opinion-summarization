---"This one has only 3 colors: red when battery's low, green when it's fully charged, and an orange-like for everything else; maybe there's a setting to change this, or you could use an third party application for it, but so far I haven't found any setting.-ConclusionThe HTC One M8 is an excellent piece of engineering, nicely crafted with a good performance and optimization, which however has some flaws that can be improved, some by software, and some will need to be taken in consideration, hopefully, for the next generation's model, and if you're reading the conclusion after reading the review, we can conclude you're a very patient person :)Thanks for your time, hope this turns out to be helpful for you!" **** 'low'

Negative Reviews:

---'At the end of everyday, which is around 11pm for me, I have 20-30% left of battery; this is a bit more battery life I had at the end of the day than on my Nexus 5.' **** 'battery'
---'Amazing Battery Life - The average battery life of my HTC One M7 was 18-20 hrs with about 3 hrs of screen on time, which is pretty amazing, my daily data usage is about 150-200MB on 4G network all time.' **** 'average'

---"This 'no power savings' statement is a bit tricky though, cause the HTC One M8 turns power saving settings automatically when battery is lower than 15%, however if you consider my previous phone had them always on, it's a huge step forward for the same battery capacity, and this is where the optimization from title comes from.-SoftwareHTC sense is extremely non intrusive personalization layer, is fast, fluid and minimalist." **** 'lower'

__________('direct', 'sunlight')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"In terms of brightness the M8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause I don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which I appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone I was just able to see some purple brights most of the time." **** 'direct'

Negative Reviews:

---'And speaking of the display, my biggest (and best) surprise came when I used the phone outside in direct sunlight.' **** 'direct'
---'The M8 is faster to adjust, stays at a better level indoors and gets to the super-bright I need in direct sunlight.' **** 'direct'

__________('power', 'button')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"In my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, I lost count on how many times I turned screen on with my previous phone while I was putting in into the pocket cause I accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-ScreenThe M8 screen it's a beautiful screen, I was a bit worried about this cause I was used to the AMOLED displays from Samsung, but once used this one for a while I should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, I don't know if it's because all of the time I've spent with AMOLED screens, but they seem way bright in the M8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all." **** 'top'

---"Overall, I have to say I'm quite impressed with the camera, but it's pretty obvious there are phones with better cameras on the market, I'd be lying if I said this was the best camera on a phone I've tried." **** 'best'
---'The camera is good, but resolution could be higher.' **** 'good'
---'The main camera is more or less the same as was featured on the m7, a 4-megapixel sensor.' **** 'main'

---"0 is a friendly UICONS:- UltraPixel Camera, that's good but should be improved" **** 'good'
---'And the phone does what a high-tech phone is almost obliged to do, there might be a few features that you would like to have like wireless charging, perhaps a better camera (4 ultra pixel is okay, but again, just okay), but in the end, is a piece of art, impressed with the battery life.' **** 'better'
---"The camera gets the most hate on the new HTC and honestly I don't know why HTC couldn't up the specs to be on par with other flagship phones." **** 'hate'

---'In spite of ultra pixels, 4 megapixel camera still makes me feel bad.' **** 'bad'
---'Ok, the camera is not its best but it is just enough for a phone at this time of tech.' **** 'best'
---'I will focus on the main camera as I find the depth sensor lens to be quiet gimmicky and of no significant use.' **** 'main'
---'This camera is good but not great.' **** 'good'
---"If it's true more mega pixels doesn't fully means a better camera, it's also true this one still lacks of the minimum required amount of pixels to be at pair with his competitors, I hope they find a way to add more pixels to the camera, this would make cover the weakest point of this phone.-AudioThis topic is with no doubt one of the shiniest for HTC, last year's One was way more ahead from the rest, and this year they've done it again." **** 'better'
