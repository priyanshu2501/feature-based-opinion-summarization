---"after using the m8 for a month i can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.as a negative point i'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.in my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, i lost count on how many times i turned screen on with my previous phone while i was putting in into the pocket cause i accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-screenthe m8 screen it's a beautiful screen, i was a bit worried about this cause i was used to the amoled displays from samsung, but once used this one for a while i should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, i don't know if it's because all of the time i've spent with amoled screens, but they seem way bright in the m8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all." **** 'beautiful'

---"after using the m8 for a month i can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.as a negative point i'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.in my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, i lost count on how many times i turned screen on with my previous phone while i was putting in into the pocket cause i accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-screenthe m8 screen it's a beautiful screen, i was a bit worried about this cause i was used to the amoled displays from samsung, but once used this one for a while i should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, i don't know if it's because all of the time i've spent with amoled screens, but they seem way bright in the m8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all." **** 'uncomfortable'

Negative Reviews:

---"but one point where htc did great is on the memory expansion capabilities via microsd card, i listen to music most of the time and have around 40gb of music on my phone at the moment, this was a big plus for me.speakers/audio: two of the many reasons i wanted this phone were the dual front facing speakers and in a couple of words: they don't dissappoint at all!" **** 'music'

---"putting that aside, htc's skin on android is very easy to use and if your someone like me who likes using stock android, you will be happy using htc sense because of how light of an overlay it is and it is definitely not as heavy as something like samsung's touchwiz." **** 'aside'
---'in contrast, my last htc phone, the mytouch 4g, is like three years old and still perfect.' **** 'last'
---'especially for the 5inch screen it has!summary:all together i love the new htc one m8, its battery life is so much better, its camera fits my needs, and the boomsound is amazing.' **** 'new'

---'my last htc phone was the sensation and it sucked.' **** 'last'

Negative Reviews:

---"navigating through apps and making phone calls never experience lags thanks to the powerful snapdragons.the camera gets the most hate on the new htc and honestly i don't know why htc couldn't up the specs to be on par with other flagship phones." **** 'new'
---"an example of these green tones are present in the google play store in the apps and games buttons, i'll add some images later from the phone so you can appreciate it.in terms of brightness the m8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause i don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which i appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone i was just able to see some purple brights most of the time.the automatic brightness could be improved later, looks so close to the highest brightness for my personal likes.-camerathis was one of the things that kept me skeptical about the phone cause i heard a lot of complains about the first htc one and the ultra pixel technology, so i was expecting ugly and blurry photos." **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---"overall, i have to say i'm quite impressed with the camera, but it's pretty obvious there are phones with better cameras on the market, i'd be lying if i said this was the best camera on a phone i've tried.on the battery side, most of my week (6/7 days) i get up at 6am and go to work, i have wifi on throughout the day and mobile data when i'm commuting, answer mails and the occasional social networking usage (facebook, twitter, line, whatsapp and instagram), but most importantly i can't live without music and because of that in my regular day i usually listen about 7-9 hours of music on my phone, ." **** 'music'
---'the next day, the phone only lost around 30-40% charge after more than 18 hours of light to moderate use (facebook, instagram, email, whatsapp, music, youtube and internet browsing).' **** 'light'
---'i have it set to turn on battery saver at 20% which gives me an extra 2 hours or so and at 5%, htc extreme battery mode turns on and i get another 6 hours or so at 5% while retaining the ability to text, call, use email, and calculator.' **** 'extra'
---"my previous phone had a 2600 mah, which used to last in average more than 3 and less than 4 hours of screen on before battery runs out, sometimes i was close to the 4 hours, in terms of hours without having to charge the phone that meant 8-10 hours on the heaviest use i gave it, 12 average and having power saving options on except for processor one, 14-16 on light use and around 20 hours using power saving additional options, being that the record i got with that phone.the htc one m8 comes with a 2600 mah battery too, in terms of screen on hours before the battery runs out, it lasts in average more than 5 hours and less than 6 and i've passed the 6 hours sometimes." **** 'less'

---"if you don't use a sd card in your phone that won't be any deal, you just need to pick the one you like more from the play store (there are a lot, with beautiful and polished ui and a lot of people make their default from there anyway), but if you have a sd card this will mean some problems and uncomfortable situations for you; since android 4.4 google restricted the sd card write access to only google apps and the third party applications installed by the manufacturer, so not having a preset one or a google provided one, you won't be able to modify anything from the sd card without connecting the phone to a pc." **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---'with the help of a launcher you can actually avoid using the power button at all.+ amazing battery, holds up from 6am to 11pm having mobile data on and listening to music for more than 6 hours a day.- metal unibody will scratch easily.- terrible button placement for one hand use, which again, is fixable through other apps (double tapping to lock).- unprecise responsiveness of earphones/headphones controls (play/pause, next and previous track).- camera could have been much better.' **** 'other'

---"it's hard to say if one is better than the other as they both have advantages in certain scenarios, but one thing is clear:  this phone is much louder than the m7 and still sounds great!" **** 'clear'
---"the phone is fast, you can feel the difference between the sanpdragon 600 and the 800 series, it executes everything smoothly.saying there's a phone with no lag at all anytime is a beautiful lie, i've seen random lags, freezes and delays even in iphones; this is not the perfect phone, however they barely happen, at least with the time i've been using it and with the usage i've been making of it, you can't compare it to touchwiz, that's miles ahead in terms of lag and delay competition, even if that's not a good thing.a real downside and a bad thing of this non intrusive ui i've found is, however, the lack of a default file explorer." **** 'bad'
