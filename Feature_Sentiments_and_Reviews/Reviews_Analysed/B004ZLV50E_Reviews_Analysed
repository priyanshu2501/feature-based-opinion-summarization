__________('update',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i have had this iphone for less than a year it constantly freezes up since the last update (which looks like it might be intentional from apple to force the iphone 4 update) the battery life sucks as it spends 60% of its time looking for a signal, it white screens locking up and resulting in waiting for the damn battery to die to reset it, the camera is good, safari crashes a lot, the touch typing is a nightmare and seeing some of the texts you send from this thing to other people will surly make them think your drunk as they are so garbled.' **** 'last'
