---'the only complaint is the very small storage space.' **** 'small'

Negative Reviews:

---"i really don't have any complaints about this device.it has good speed with it's krait architecture and dual core snapdragon processor.the 1gb of installed ram helps, as well.very fast on t-mobile's lte network and where there is not lte coverage i am getting great speeds on their 42+ frequency.it has excellent battery life with it's beefy lithium-ion 2,460 mah battery... and for me, i am a heavy user who is constantly checking my phone throughout the day and i get 24 hours without having to recharge, a huge plus!the screen is very bright at only a setting of 20% and is very good in it's true to nature colors ips display.the thing i would add, is to make sure and get an micro sd card as the 4gb of rom is mostly taken up by the bloatware of t-mobile so you will need to have that extra storage capacity.highly recommended!" **** 'extra'
---"it doesn't have much internal storage." **** 'much'
---'if you are not a big gamer or horder of big apps, you may not run into any problems with the storage, but then again you might, which could be annoying.good:cheepamazing battery life (over 2 days with normal use)stock rom is very good, responsive, stablenicely designed, including hardware home buttonaverage camerasbad:lack of internal storage (can be completely overcome by the casual computer user with a couple of hours on their hands).bloatware, made more annoying than usual because it eats up the limited storage (again, if you are familiar with computers and can follow instructions, this can be completely overcome by rooting the device and deleting the bloatware with titanium backup).i recommend doing a search for the xda developers forum called &#34;t-moble lg optimus f3 forum?&#34; there you will find rooting instructions (third page).' **** 'usual'
---'cannot store many apps on sdonly 1.5 gb on harddrivebloatware hogs hard drive storage' **** 'drive'

Positive Reviews:

---'but, i can not download any games to play because this phone has so very little internal memory.' **** 'little'

Negative Reviews:

---'this phone has so little internal memory that its essentially useless.' **** 'useless'
---'videos are okay, but not great.weakness: only a tiny 1.2gb of internal memory is available after you update the pre-installed apps such as google maps.to free  internal memory: for each app you do not use, go into "settings", to "apps", select "all apps" and look for apps using more than 1mb of memory that you never use.' **** 'available'

__________('4g', 'lte')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the t-mobile 2g network is often faster than the sprint 3g network my old phone used, and it is fast enough for email, news and streaming pandora radio.the f3 has an sharp four inch screen in a compact body weighing just four ounces, similar in size to the apple iphone 5. the dual core processor is fast enough for most apps, but not for some 3d action games.although the lg f3 is one of the smallest 4g lte phones available, it has a massive battery that lasts 50% longer than the average smartphone.' **** 'smallest'

Negative Reviews:

---'the lg optimus f3 is a first: a small and light 4g lte phone that combines ultra-high speed 4g lte with fast hspa+ data speeds.' **** 'small'
---'the lg optimus f3 is a first: a small and light 4g lte phone that combines ultra-high speed 4g lte with fast hspa+ data speeds.' **** 'light'
---"metropcs customers enjoy unlimited use of the t-mobile network for just $40 a month including all taxes and fees.the t-mobile lg f3 delivers consistently fast data speeds in 70% of america's largest cities because it connects to both t-mobile's new 4g lte network and also to their very fast hspa+ 3g network.note: the t-mobile coverage map lets you enter your zip code and zoom in to see the quality of the 4g coverage on your block.outside of major cities, the lg f3 will get bumped down to t-mobile's 2g edge network." **** 'new'
