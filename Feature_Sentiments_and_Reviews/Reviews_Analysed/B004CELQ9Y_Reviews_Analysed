---'the major issues were:1- the keyboard is too small2- the phone is slow and sometimes "think" for a second or two before respond.3- battery life is a joke, only few hours if you use apps.now with pre 2, the speed feels 10x better, the applications window shows up fast and no "thinking" time pause,, great performance.unfortunately, the keyboard is the same, too small for average hands, and the battery has improved tiny bit.. still need better battery.so with the pre 2, the only gripe is the keyboard, however, you can get used to it if you type slowly..this should have been the first pre!' **** 'second'

Positive Reviews:

---"hp app catalog is not working(you won't be able to download any apps, just stick with the presets), your phone book contacts pictures will look awful, blurry and really small no matter what you do (good pictures quality contacts pictures on old palm was one of the highlights why i loved old palm), phone calls quality, much worse than on the previous one... well to make long story short: i returned this one to teczilla and ordered palm pre plus on gsm network." **** 'worse'

Positive Reviews:

---"the battery life was dismal, i needed to purchase the seido 2600mah replacement battery.i actually jumped into buying this phone without doing my research, i actually purchased a hp touchpad and thought that this phone supports the touch transfer (or whatever it's called) function, but i know know that's only on the pre 3.i've now purchased a pre 3 because it has a better screen and camera and supports the touch transfer function.the pre 2 is still a great phone, a pleasure to use, with the homebrew apps i was able to overclock the cpu without any problems." **** 'better'
---'i wanted touch screen technology, wifi, gps, and a keyboard, but without the extra cost of blackberry messaging.i initially had my doubts about this phone, but after using it a few days and upgrading to the latest operating system ... i fell in love with both the ergonomics of the handset and the easy to use operating system.' **** 'touch'
---'how can a handset be so small and have such a clear easy to read screen?' **** 'clear'

Negative Reviews:

---"even with it's age and lack of updates it is less buggy and more convenient that either of the two major players out there, they are constantly being improved and are no better after all that development time.pick up a gsm version and pop in a net10 sim card and you've got the full smart phone experience for cheap $.only complaint; i wish the screen were a little larger." **** 'larger'
