---'however, the e71 is much smaller than both (just put the e71 side to side with the blackberry curve and the iphone and they both look like monsters compared to the e71).- very fast 3g capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved os and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3mp camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable' **** 'long'
---"just type the person's name and then push the green button to call or select text message from the slide-out menu and start texting.the os is ugly (the contact screen and the individual calendar entries are just atrocious - sub-old-blackberry ugly), but fairly stable and very responsive.overall, if need an activesync phone with a longer battery life and can live without great email (yes, that is an oxymoron, i know), and you have extra cash to purchase the necessary software, then the nokia e71 is your phone.but overall, i am very disappointed in the os, the lack of real email support that us customers have comes to expect, and the expense of all the extra software you need to buy on top of an already very expensive phone." **** 'longer'
---'ability to be on skype all-day (of course, if you have data plan) can save you a lot of money, if you make/receive international calls (you can make skype-skype free or skype-phone for lower rates without using your minutes)* you can add more memory using micro sdhc card and applications can be installed on phone memory or card* good battery life (at least to my expectations) - with wifi and 3g turned on, push-email set to immediate notification, fring running always and lots of browsing, i get through 2 days.' **** 'good'
---'all the rest (os mainly) is just up to personal preference.concluding remarks: if you ask "why should i get the e71", i would answer with these points based on what "i" feel is most important:- very fast 3g capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved os and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3mp camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable- and lastly, did i mention that this is the most beautiful i have ever seen?' **** 'long'
---'average battery life is typically of nokia and needs recharging every third day with regular use.using an 8gb micro sd card, many applications have been installed plus 50 mp-3 albums, podcasts, like 20 video clips, several long ms-word documents, pp presentations, excel charts and even pdfs plus ten full movies compressed to 300 mb each under avi format.' **** 'average'
---"i wanted a smartphone, and thought the iphone was the way to go...then i found out it had no stereo bluetooth (unacceptable to me for my next phone), the forced data plan was kinda pricey to be locked into, i didn't like the plastic of the new 3g version, and i heard the battery life wasn't very good." **** 'good'

---'however, the e71 is much smaller than both (just put the e71 side to side with the blackberry curve and the iphone and they both look like monsters compared to the e71).- very fast 3g capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved os and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3mp camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable' **** 'long'
---"just type the person's name and then push the green button to call or select text message from the slide-out menu and start texting.the os is ugly (the contact screen and the individual calendar entries are just atrocious - sub-old-blackberry ugly), but fairly stable and very responsive.overall, if need an activesync phone with a longer battery life and can live without great email (yes, that is an oxymoron, i know), and you have extra cash to purchase the necessary software, then the nokia e71 is your phone.but overall, i am very disappointed in the os, the lack of real email support that us customers have comes to expect, and the expense of all the extra software you need to buy on top of an already very expensive phone." **** 'longer'

---'all the rest (os mainly) is just up to personal preference.concluding remarks: if you ask "why should i get the e71", i would answer with these points based on what "i" feel is most important:- very fast 3g capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved os and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3mp camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable- and lastly, did i mention that this is the most beautiful i have ever seen?' **** 'long'
