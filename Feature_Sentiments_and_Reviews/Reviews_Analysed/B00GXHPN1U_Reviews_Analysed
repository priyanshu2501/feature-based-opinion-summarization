---"i bought it for my mom, since she is finally getting rid of her five year old &#34;cant-even-open-a-webpage-anymore&#34; blackberry.i've had android cell phones since the 1.5 cupcake version, and let me tell you this is a nice android experience, no useless manufacturer skin overlay, the phone has almost-stock android jelly bean, and let me tell you it performs really fast, fast as a more expesive phone sometimes can't.the cameras and processor are really good for a phone at this price range, the design is very common, as seen on other android phones (i'm looking at you samsung), a little rounded and very ergonomic, although it feels a little weak because of the materials used (cheap plastic) but it compensates with an included screen protector and a case that would keep the phone safe on the event of a drop.it also includes a very nice set of hand-free headphones, of the &#34;canal&#34; type with awesome ear tips replacements because god and the manufacturers know we usually get those lostapps run swiftly, even 3d games (i tested it with subway surfers) and you can enjoy from all the benefits of the google play store and the google apps like maps, youtube, google now and so on.what i didn't like was the screen viewing angles, if you take a glimpse at it from the side, its like someone applied a negative filter on the entire phone; that's not a deal breaker though, because looking directly on front of it, the image quality is good enough, and hey!" **** 'google'
