---"The V710 isn't a bad phone but nothing mind blowing either.+the signal is pretty much always strong even compared to other Verizon users.+the screen is bright and nice looking.+accessories are available and aren't too expensive either.+expansion card are cheap... picked a 256MB for $30." **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"however, verizon's definitely taken this opportunity to attempt to foil the gadget guru crowd, which previously enjoyed hacks for free wireless web and the like." **** 'free'
---"It is possible that this is a Verizon only issue, their store tech support is absolute garbage (although their telephone customer service people are models of polite helpfulness - go figure) and denied there was any problem because they couldn't reproduce it after a couple of test calls." **** 'possible'
---'As far as the service goes I cannot be happier with Verizon.' **** 'happier'
---'That being said, I\'m sure the reason this "high-end" phone is now inexpensive is Verizon\'s miscalculation when they disabled most of the v710\'s Bluetooth capabilities.' **** 'inexpensive'

---'I could go on and on about the advantages the V710 has over the other Verizon phones but let me sum it up this way: (1) best reception (2) best sound quality (3) top of the line speaker phone (4) excellent display (5) trans-flash expandable memory (6) mediocre camera, but it does take short movie clips (7) very customizable options (8) good size and weight for most people (9) bluetooth connectivity works great for most users (10) plastic, but very solid build quality.' **** 'other'
