Positive Reviews:

---"each phone number occupies a line in the phone book, so needless to say, the phonebook list is way longer than it needs to be (very few people that i contact frequently have only 1 phone number... i think my grandma is the only person i know that has only 1 phone number)it isn't a bad phone otherwise.. maybe i've just come to expect more from a cell phone (for example, my less expensive sony ericsson t610 had full bluetooth addressbook/calendar sync, a more neatly organized phonebook.. although took slightly lower quality pictures)." **** 'lower'
---'stay away from this one!i have never witnessed such poor quality control in my life.' **** 'poor'

Negative Reviews:

---'i recently purchased an lg vx8600 in the hopes of adding stereo bluetooth to all the features i love about the v710 but was very dissapointed in the lg.the v710 beats the lg in speaker and music quality and volume, ease of use (no single camera button and volume control is on the top half of the flip phone on the lg), the touch sensitive outer mp3 buttons are too easy to accidentally hit), the lg music manager (vcast) only allows for single songs to be added to playlists (very time consuming), no 2.5mm headphone jack.' **** 'music'
