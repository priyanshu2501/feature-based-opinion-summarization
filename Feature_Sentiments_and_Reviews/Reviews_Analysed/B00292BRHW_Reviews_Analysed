Negative Reviews:

---"i have had my blackberry for about 16 months now.i love the features on the phone,but after about 12 months i started running into a few problems.i can be on the phone talking to someone and it seems like if i'm on it too long,i can hear the person on the other line,but they can't hear me.once i hang up and they call me or i call them,things are fine.also the reception isn't the greatest.my 8320 doesn't even roam.i don't know if it's my carrier (t-mobile)or if these phones just don't roam.another problem and the most annoying,is this phone freezes a lot.then you have to take the battery out to restart it.that usually takes a good 5 minutes to restart.it's very annoying.other than that the phone has a lot of good features.my favorite is how you can crop a picture from the internet and send it as a mms message.i would not buy this phone again.i'm debating if i want to try a newer blackberry." **** 'favorite'
