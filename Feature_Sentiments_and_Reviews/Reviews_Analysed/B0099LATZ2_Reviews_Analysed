Positive Reviews:

---'i found it is actually a good device but if the 1 year manufacturer warranty is important to you, then you may want to buy an iphone.when warranty is the issue, seller won\'t help, amazon won\'t help and samsung won\'t help...whenever you ask for warranty (samsung us, samsung latin america) they will say "it is from amazon...we don\'t support that".these were the answers i received:- amazon: they will tell you that it was bought in amazon but through a 3rd party (which is difficult to tell by any customer because you will only see that in the check out screen), so they won\'t help.' **** 'difficult'

---'all the thumbnails for all your videos appear, and when you hover the s-pen over one it enlarges a bit and gives you a preview of the video with sound without actually opening it.i downloaded a couple of my favorite apps for a smartphone for watching tv.' **** 'favorite'
---"it's not bad but it's full of apps i don't use and drains your battery faster." **** 'bad'
---"the note 2 is a high quality music player, it just needs a nicer looking music player interface.i've tried the same apps on other android devices, but on the note 2 they run better and faster.like i said, this phone is a better version of the siii in everyway." **** 'other'
---"things that made me break my contract and switch to this phone was the screen size, widgets, customizable os (having multiple programs be able to open/share my pdfs or pictures, more efficient keyboard etc), free apps, notifications, and google's products: gmail, calendar (the widget and month view are why i finally switched i missed a meeting with apple's calendar) maps, voice etc, that i love and are better experienced on the android." **** 'free'

Negative Reviews:

---"i actually bought it on amazon europe but i felt like reviewing it on amazon.com too, since more people read the reviews here.so here we go:after being a happy owner of a galaxy s phone, which was an ok phone for it's time, now i am thrilled with this one.all the problems i had with the galaxy s are gone.it's fast, it does not lag, it has 2gb of ram (which is tons of ram for a phone) and it does the job efficiently without a hitch!no crashes like the galaxy s, no dropped calls, no force closing apps due to ram shortage." **** 'due'
---"the rest of samsung's apps aren't good." **** 'good'
---'you can even download torrents and use pdfs, office files and scan and everything (with the proper apps, and i only download free apps).structurally, the build quality looks pretty good but the phone is mostly plastic and very fragile.' **** 'free'
