Negative Reviews:

---"the samsung does not fare well in comparison and needs daily charging, but there's a number of things you can do to prevent high power consumption like turning off features you're not using and not playing music through it (if using the phone principally as an ipod-like music player is important to you, then this samsung may not be for you as battery life will be reduced to a few hours).4. the blackberry is small and handy in size, whereas the samsung is 3x larger (but about the same thickness) - however in compensation, you get that amazing huge screenhere's a summary of the main features of this amazing phone from my non-techie perspective:* the amoled screen on the skyrocket is definitely its star attraction: huge, bright and clear with fabulous colour definition, it's even better than the iphone or ipod." **** 'important'

---"the phone is designed well - the screen is a good size, it can run all the apps i use - which is quite a few and some of them require serious processing, and it's lte capability doesn't disappoint." **** 'good'
---"designers have finally copped-on that people don't want ever smaller and smaller phones and no-one wants to watch a movie on a screen 1.5cm square; they want something of a convenient size that they can use and read easily at arm's length* despite the substantial size, it's thin and lightweight at only 116g which makes it no problem in your pocket and a big advantage to a smaller person when making long calls (the iphone for example is around 20g heavier)* all functions are very intuitive and easy to use - at least as good as the ipod4 with a similar feel* calls are easy to make due to the big clear graphics and easy-to-follow menus - however it has some minor quirks like you can't answer a call by actually pressing the green phone symbol, you have to `sweep' across it - but once you learn this, everything is ok. the ear-speaker and voice-mike are both very good and very clear; reception so far first-class with no dropped calls* the quality of the image from the camera is also exemplary (but make sure the flash is turned on)* the samsung has a standard connect-to-computer/mains charger socket, a micro-usb port located on the base-edge of the phone." **** 'convenient'
