Negative Reviews:

---'you will not be disappointed.- almost forgot to mention the mp3 player.... yea its great too.-oh and the phone+phone book is also perfect and responsive syncs with your facebooks and twitters and googles.-lack of a front-facing camera is a slight let down.... battery.....-the battery that this phone ships with satisfies.-it is always advisable to allow the battery to charge fully before turning it on for the first time though many people will not be able to do that.-on a full charge this phone can last more than 4 days sleeping.-with regular usage which includes browsing music messages and phone calls i easily get 2 sometimes 3 days of battery life but i allow my battery to drain fully before i charge it.-note that to conserve battery i only turn on gps or wifi when i am about to use them and the screen is set to automatic brightness.......closing.....-despite this phone coming out in 2010 it still competes with phones from this year and in some cases even defeats them.-runs android 2.3.4 which is a fantastic os and ui.' **** 'advisable'

__________('keyboard',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the keyboard is really nice as i hate touch screen keyboards.' **** 'nice'
---'i got this phone because i read that it has a good keyboard.' **** 'good'
---"the front has a very attractive metal border with that scratchy-metal texture that looks great and a trackpad with a chrome-y finish- the screen is just the right size about as big as it can be for the the size of the phone.-it's a bit thick because of the qwertyboard but i am ok with that and it looks good when the keyboard is slid out or put away.-the back of it has a metal battery cover with that scratchy texture to it and it looks great." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---'i have exactly what i need in a phone, and for half the price of the newer phones that only have a stupid virtual keyboard.' **** 'stupid'
---"*has only 1 processor, extremely fast*- phone accepts 32 gb sd card (class 10) and can have the sd booster application installed that will use caching capabilities.- $150 is a good overall price for this type of phonenow the cons/negatives:- phones backing is easily scratchable, especially if you put your phone in with your key pocket.- phone will sometimes shut off by itself without touching anything (even its rom or unrom)- phone sometimes freezes up through out the use.- the keyboard opens, but it opens upward then downward by small plastic hinges- the lighting on the keyboard sometimes turns on and sometimes doesn't.- phone has only an internal of around 1.5 to 2 gb." **** 'upward'
---'it consists of three appropriately shaped metal pieces that hold the two halves of the phone together in a way that looks like a z when viewed from the side.-the hinges are made of metal so good luck breaking them they look and feel solid yet they do not cause the phone to snap harshly on itself when the keyboard comes out.-the phone is made of quality materials through and through from the metallic pieces on the front to the textured metal battery cover- just feels great to look at and hold in your hand.-regular size headphone jack and mini usb as well as a micro sd slot next to the battery do their job.....keyboard+buttons.....-i mentioned earlier that i insist on having a qwertyboard on my phone.-though this phone does not have the best keyboard on a phone...- it is the best android phone with a keyboard that i have experienced.-the keyboard has all of your letters of the alphabet with enter,delete, space, comma, period, as well as an...-"@" and a ".com" keys which are very useful.-each key has alternate forms which are achieved by the shift and alt keys.-the keyboard on this is capable of accomplishing just about any typing task that your computer keyboard can accomplish except....-it does not have number keys, instead it has alt-forms of the top row of keys so if you want to type numbers you have to hit alt first then use the top row of keys.' **** 'best'
