---'i am told that the mini version of outlook "syncs" with you home pc, but i have never tried that, and don\'t really want to...i\'ll leave that to more intrepid souls who have bluetooth set up on their pcs or laptops.the downside of windows 7 phones:  nowhere near as many free apps as you get with an iphone or android phone.the upside of windows 7 phones:  if you are careful with your settings, you can protect your privacy, which you really can\'t do with the other phones, from what i\'ve heard.update: we got these phones as part of an at&t; u-verse package.' **** 'free'
