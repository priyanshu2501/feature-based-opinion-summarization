Positive Reviews:

---'i was blown away at the quality of the screen, the 5.2 inches is also a very nice size, only minor gripe would be that the buttons being on the screen itself will decrease the size by a bit, however when watching youtube videos or most other videos on the phone, the buttons with fade out and give you the full 5.2 inches of viewing pleasure.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---"i love the ease of just double tapping the screen without having to find the small power button, i'm now so used to it that i tend to do it to other phones and devices without thinking and it takes me a moment to realize i'm not on my g2.kitkat - lg put out the 4.4 update and verizon has their version.nice large beautiful screen with great color!the pictures you'll take on this are great and can be even better with some extra apps.amazon app store - i know it's available on any android device, but the free app of the day is a great deal!cons:bloatware - there are a lot of unnecessary apps and features on this phone, but you can easily find a list of those apps online and disable them; increasing your battery life a bit further.the size of this phone can also be a con for some." **** 'beautiful'

Positive Reviews:

---"i love the ease of just double tapping the screen without having to find the small power button, i'm now so used to it that i tend to do it to other phones and devices without thinking and it takes me a moment to realize i'm not on my g2.kitkat - lg put out the 4.4 update and verizon has their version.nice large beautiful screen with great color!the pictures you'll take on this are great and can be even better with some extra apps.amazon app store - i know it's available on any android device, but the free app of the day is a great deal!cons:bloatware - there are a lot of unnecessary apps and features on this phone, but you can easily find a list of those apps online and disable them; increasing your battery life a bit further.the size of this phone can also be a con for some." **** 'small'

---"after using this phone for a few days i'm not at all dissappointed with lg's software, i  i did not see it as invasive at all, i actually like lg's software and find it very useful for the most part, and the parts i don't like are easily ignored.verizon and lg did load a lot of bloatware on the device, however it appears all the brands do that and i think it stinks that i can't unload software on my phone that i paid for.my favorite feature on this phone is that it can be used as an infrared remote control and i have 3 profiles set up for my living room, bedroom and den." **** 'invasive'
---"this is supposed to be a flagship phone from lg, but while it's a solid phone, it's not a great phone.pros:+excellent battery life (i can go several days without charging)+bright, sharp screen+good sound/call quality+comes with gsm sim unlocked so you can pop in a sim for at&t;, t-mobile, or any gsm carrier worldwide, and it works!cons:-disappointing camera; shots just don't look good no matter what the lighting conditions are; they look like they were taken with a cheap digital camera from 10 years ago-comes loaded with the usual lg & verizon bloatware, some of which can't even be disabled-still hasn't updated to kitkat, although it's supposed to be coming-awkward back button-knock-on feature is inconsistent-requires a micro-sim, which can be more expensive-the back cover is very slippery; it's almost slid out of my hands." **** 'usual'

---"the wifi radio is far superior to my motorola razr maxx, i now get good wifi at work where is before it was spotty.it has an awesome camera with many features and presets.i bought the lg flip case with the smart window and it is a pretty awesome case with cool features like showing a clock through the window, controlling mp3 player and weather, you can also answer the phone without opening the case, all you have to do is lift it to your ear and it automatically answers the call as it has a sensor that knows it is lifted to your face.you can set up a guest mode on this phone so when someone swipes the unlock pattern with a pattern that is not yours you can configure it to go into a guest mode and set up what they can and can't access.the buttons on the back of the phone are not an issue to me, i really don't need to use them at all, i can do everything from the screen.the qslide feature is pretty neat, you can open up programs on top of other programs like for instance i want to jot down a phone number and be able to see it while i use the phone keypad at the same time, or open up a calculator when you are paying bills online.so, in conclusion ,if you are waiting for the next best phone to come out like the galaxy s5 or the htc one (2nd gen) they probably won't be much better than this phone hardware wise." **** 'open'

---'pushed to the limit you cancan squeeze about 5 to 6 hours of on screen time which was double my previous phone the galaxy note i i.  button placement on the rear of the phone does take some adjustment but within a few days it felt natural.' **** 'natural'
---'i thinkthe super fast processor also causes battery drain.display- absolutely beautiful.. but the first 3 days it was very dark.' **** 'first'
---'however, i would give a nod to samsung in the usefulness of their contacts and that it looked more like the phone was supposed to have the options, and the lg seems much plainer and starts to bring back memories of the palm pilot days, simple and straight forward and not as nice as the samsung.' **** 'simple'
