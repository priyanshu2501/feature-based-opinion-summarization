---'this is a little cumbersome however.although this phone does not have integrated gps, the agps functionality seems to work with google maps.' **** 'google'
---'quick takeaway: the phone for people with things to do, not for single-tasking, pinky dragging poseurs.i got this phone to be able to check email and surf the web while connected to wi-fi, not my carrier\'s data plans... the way it works is you open the "web" application and at that point specify your wi-fi connection name and password; you need to also specify that you\'re always asked before connecting; to disable applications from connecting to your carrier for data you need to specify the option "when needed" for "packet data connection" in settings / connection / packet data... my carrier is sneaky enough to offer certain services which (a) connect to them for data automatically, (b) have a cost themselves besides the data sent and received and (c) are a pain to stop... you can imagine just how much brand loyalty that inspires... with all these settings in place it seems you can always only connect to available wifi hotspots... but i\'ll be 100% sure when i get my monthly bill...about the phone here\'s a list of pros:- very reasonable price- actual, for real, physical keyboard, which is comfortable to use even for people with large hands; good keyboard shortcuts to get to where you want fast; copy paste to your heart\'s content- multitasking: leave an app running while you do other things- much better reception than my previous phone (sonyericsson w880); no more mad dashes to the nearest window, yay!- can surf the web; gmail app, google maps, opera, fring (instant messaging from your phone: addictive!' **** 'google'
---'for me, the "edge" network is sufficient, but it would have been even better had the phone been able to access t-mobile\'s 3g network (supposedly, e63 can access at&t;\'s 3g), can\'t ask too much from an unlocked phone that costs only $149 and a data plan that is only 10 bucks a month i suppose...  ;)best apps - google maps and skyfire, must have\'s!google maps alone is practically worth $10 a month.' **** 'google'
---'and though it is not gps equipped and won\'t give you turn by turn instructions, it does a good job of triangulating/estimating your location from the cell towers, so you can use google maps to effectively search for things near you.skyfire - version 1.5 was just made available, and this app works great at rendering most any webpage as you would see it on your computer, no more "mobile" versions of webpages!' **** 'google'

---'bottom line: this phone provides a solid operating with great call quality and decent features.i have had this phone for a few days now, and i must say it is perfect for me.' **** 'perfect'
---'works perfect in the us and in central america.100% signal over 3g networks, on gsm performs good too.battery last 3 days, i find that a bit discouraging but overall is a great phone' **** 'last'
---'not a nokia fan, and neither is my son for whom i bought this one.he was eager for a touch screen phone, but knowing his amount of text messages i "overruled" his wishes :) and purchased this one.after a few days of grumble from him he came to admit that typing with these small buttons is much easier and faster than with touch screen (let him try mine with touch screen).' **** 'grumble'

Negative Reviews:

---"i was able to get 5 days out of a charge with light usage (30 texts per day, maybe 20 minutes on the phone per day and 10-15 minutes per day surfing using the wifi)the cons i've found:nokia still hasn't set up a threaded text messaging system as default (im style chats)." **** 'able'

Positive Reviews:

---"what's so great about this e series is that it is cheaper than the e71 and offers similar functionality (sans the gps) of the e71.currently, the purchase of this phone includes nokia mail (a free service), which is similar to blackberry mail where mail is pushed directly to the phone within minutes of receiving new mail)." **** 'similar'

---"i downloaded nokia's new mail client, which is a lot more graceful.there are lots of apps available on the internet for this operating system, but they're scattered all over the place and they're hard to find unless you really know what you're looking for." **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---"email service: i am using nokia's free (for now) mail push service; it pushes my yahoo mails and the other mails to my e63, it notifies me when there is a new mail." **** 'new'

__________('calls',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"is not this particular phone because i asked the retailer to send another one and the new one, also, didn't work.so, if you're buying this phone for the internet calls feature, you're totally throwing your money away.other than that, the phone is ok.  it freezes for 5 seconds after each call, i dont know why.. but that small defect drives me crazy because if im in a hurry to call someone it just freezes and i have to wait until whenever its ready again to recognize the keyboard.camera and video, sms, regular calls and the rest of the stuff works just fine." **** 'regular'
---"but the maps, which was one of the main deciding points for me, it's a big flop.another thing that disappoints me is that the sound quality for phone calls is poor." **** 'poor'
---"call quality is generally good (i have a&t; and suffer dropped calls less often than i did before, though i don't know if this can be attributed to the phone or improvements to the network.)" **** 'less'
---'by using a standard headset, you still can make calls or receive calls, but you will have to speak to the microphone in the phone.con:1. image quality of camera.' **** 'receive'
---'fast wifi, i used in mexico in movistar and works fine, with my clarion autoestero you can stream music, make and receive calls with no wires (bluetooth).' **** 'receive'
---'i have had a few dropped calls though and am not sure whether that\'s the phone or the network "lime" i am using.the phone has basically all the features you would need in a smart phone and much more, podcast, radio, maps and a whole host of apps.' **** 'dropped'

Negative Reviews:

---'first of all the audio was horrible and very low when receiving calls.' **** 'low'
