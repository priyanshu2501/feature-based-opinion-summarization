---'a good and honest review doesent just give the pro`s or the cons..but gives both, so here it ispro`s1)nice fone, clear calls, speakerphone much much better than razr, good reception.2)good camera, more so with the 6x zoom that can be used after taking the snap, can adjust brightness, has a flash, timer, night mode, can also take snaps in a sequence.3) can sync calender and notes, address book..etc..with outlook with provided cable or over bluetooth.4) converter(currency/pressure/weight/etc) works pretty good.5) have a 1 gb card with over 700 mb of mp3/images/videos/apps, works fine..no lags..6) mp3 player is pretty good, sound through attached headset is awesome.7) got a nice secure wallet app.8) can write and deploy your own java app..easily..or a game( which i did)cons:-1) accesing multiple apps ..can make the phone hang at times.2) installing apps like google maps on fone or memory card...really eats the battery..from 3-4 days to 1 or 1.5 days.3) photographs..call the first one abc..rest by default get named abc1, abc2..so on.4) adding a password to protect the sim/fone if fone is lost..adds about 2 mts to the startup time.5) nokia doesent give any free apps..like for word and excel free with the fone have to buy and install it ..99.99..additional.6) only uses " dv " rs mmc(dual voltage(1.8/3.3) reduced size mmc)7) can only schedule one alarm..multiple alarms..needs software available for 19.99(separately)8) doesent have infrared:- for those who wonder why does he want it...if present then can install a software to turn the fone into a remote for ur tv/vcr etc..' **** 'good'

---"i'd simply been through my second razr and asked if cingular warranty services could send me a different phone that would actually last." **** 'second'
---'it got to the point where we got in the habit of "rebooting" our phones at the beginning of each day to try to minimize problems.my wife got fed up with hers, so i bought her an unlocked razr.' **** 'unlocked'

Negative Reviews:

---'a good and honest review doesent just give the pro`s or the cons..but gives both, so here it ispro`s1)nice fone, clear calls, speakerphone much much better than razr, good reception.2)good camera, more so with the 6x zoom that can be used after taking the snap, can adjust brightness, has a flash, timer, night mode, can also take snaps in a sequence.3) can sync calender and notes, address book..etc..with outlook with provided cable or over bluetooth.4) converter(currency/pressure/weight/etc) works pretty good.5) have a 1 gb card with over 700 mb of mp3/images/videos/apps, works fine..no lags..6) mp3 player is pretty good, sound through attached headset is awesome.7) got a nice secure wallet app.8) can write and deploy your own java app..easily..or a game( which i did)cons:-1) accesing multiple apps ..can make the phone hang at times.2) installing apps like google maps on fone or memory card...really eats the battery..from 3-4 days to 1 or 1.5 days.3) photographs..call the first one abc..rest by default get named abc1, abc2..so on.4) adding a password to protect the sim/fone if fone is lost..adds about 2 mts to the startup time.5) nokia doesent give any free apps..like for word and excel free with the fone have to buy and install it ..99.99..additional.6) only uses " dv " rs mmc(dual voltage(1.8/3.3) reduced size mmc)7) can only schedule one alarm..multiple alarms..needs software available for 19.99(separately)8) doesent have infrared:- for those who wonder why does he want it...if present then can install a software to turn the fone into a remote for ur tv/vcr etc..' **** 'good'
---"meanwhile, i went ahead and bought myself an unlocked razr, too, and while it doesn't have as many features, it's much less frustrating for day-to-day use." **** 'unlocked'
---'software, usb cable, headset and 64mb card(not enough capacity) but comes as a package unlike moto razr that requires me to buy all of the above and the razr i have does not have memory slot.5.speakers are great and using speaker phone at home is equivalent of using headsets.6.light sensing for control of display brightness is a nice touch.7.' **** 'above'

---'i am having this phone for past 1.5 years now.features of this phone are really impressive (1.2 mp camera with sliding cover, symbian os, office application etc.' **** 'cover'

Negative Reviews:

---'the n80 has an updated os, a larger screen size, a better camera (even though it has no cover), and more on-board memory (64mb - the 6682 includes 8mb, not including the rs-mmc).if you want a phone that can be your portable computer, then check the 6682 out.' **** 'better'
---'it is just sufficient enough i guess.4) the camera shutter cover is very smooth and sensitive.' **** 'sufficient'
---'it is just sufficient enough i guess.4) the camera shutter cover is very smooth and sensitive.' **** 'smooth'
---'i use outlook and sync with it on a weekly basis.the camera is good for must have shots - even if they are a bit lacking in quality.i have played with the recorder and probably could be useful.the phone screen is first rate and the phone construction is all quality - with the exception of the thin plastic cover for the camera lens.the only downside is the mmc dual voltage memory card is only 64 meg and it is hard to find a replacement card at best buy, office depot, etc...i have read other posts about this phone having to be rebooted and i have yet to experience that - thankfully.i highly recommend this phone.my wife got the pink motorola razor phone for free and it is okay - but not near the quality of this phone.' **** 'good'
