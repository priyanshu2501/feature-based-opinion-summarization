---"with all this i average about 25%-30% of battery life a day.you might think, 'oh that's stupid, i don't want to be so obsessive-compulsive about my phones processes every day' and i agree, i recommend people like that to get a motorola razr maxx hd or an iphone if that is their opinion." **** 'stupid'

__________('better',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"very odd.in any event, i'm still discovering nice things that have been improved in the android os (currently jelly bean) from the android 2.x which was running the droid x. there's a much better cut/copy/paste ability by simply holding down your finger over text." **** 'much'
---"moderate use: playing games, making calls, using tapatalk, checking my google+, twitter, flipboard, and reading other news articles, i can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.osi could write several pages just on how much better ics is than any other android build i've used, but i'm going to leave it to you to research this." **** 'much'

__________('device',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'as soon as verizon registered my new device, everything is synced!' **** 'new'
---'i for one, was just tired of waiting and this device was the last one to allow me my unlimited data.if you have questions, ask.' **** 'last'
---'for the price, it would be better to look out for a newer device, and if you are interested in staying current with the android operating system, you might want to look elsewhere.' **** 'newer'
---'verizon has crippled the software and will not provide any valid reason or a way to unlock the full potential of this device.' **** 'potential'
---"i've had many cell phones, have dropped them many times & have never seen anything like this.....could care less about this samsung device or any other they make." **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2 but that's every single verizon droid anyway...it also doesn't have a few things that other carriers get...but again..that's verizon...reviewing all of those things separately is pointless since you'd have to give those negatives for a lot of verizon phones....what verizon does do is offer insane 4g speeds and great reception.as far as this device goes you can find it this week for $50 at most places which makes it an instant win over the competition, plus it's got removable storage, something the dna and nexus don't have...and a removable giant battery (something the maxx hd doesn't have).the note 2 is more powerful and a little cooler, but it might be too big for people.my vote: dna=1st, note 2=2nd, gs3=3rd, maxx hd=4th....overall though, im an android nerd and this thing rocks.as for the apple people....if it was $200 for both i'd ask what equipment you have in your home...if you say all apple products then go with the iphone...but this device is bigger, has an actual hd screen, and you can really make it your own with customizing." **** 'bigger'

Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"verizon is my last hope and i really don't relish the thought of setting my phone up all over again ... but i guess it's my only chance of getting any kind of decent smart phone that is even as good as my 2 year old phone i just got rid of." **** 'good'

__________('home',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the only compliant i had was the lag when pressing the main home button.' **** 'main'

Negative Reviews:

---'admittedly, a year ago a hardware menu button was still usable, but the back button is on the wrong side, making it awkward to go back and forth between this and my nexus 7. putting an actual home button instead of a capacitive one is a move that screams apple copycat, and also is annoying.' **** 'actual'

Negative Reviews:

---'it never lags or makes me wait for anything.call quality- i am shocked that some have complained about the call quality because i have experienced very good call quality.' **** 'good'

__________('galaxy', 's3')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"when in quiet places, i generally have a pretty good success rate when using s voice, but i'm really hoping when jellybean gets pushed to the s3 that google now will really pick up the slack.pop up play - i've never used it, as i see no practical use in it.share shot - would be a great feature if the only phone in the world was the s3prosbeautiful screengorilla glass 2smooth running osspeedy, high quality camera4grobust customization optionsfast gps lock (i didn't mention this in the review, but the gps lock on this phone is incredibly fast)conslocked bootloader (verizon only)no google wallet (such a horrible move on verizon's part)battery cover hard to remove (minor complaint but still worth noting especially if you ever need to change your battery)speaker placementconclusion: you would be a wise man indeed to purchase a samsung galaxy s3." **** 'google'
---'i was able to get the galaxy s3 for $29.99.' **** 'able'
---"there are countless apps that have all varients of the galaxy s3 listed but not the verizon model (now that hackers have found a way around verizons modifications of the phones software it has changed a bit but you have to hack your phone to get to the point all other galaxy s3's are straight from the box?)" **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---'on the sd card on the razrs.best of all the razr m is $150 cheaper than the galaxy s3 or the iphone 5.' **** 'cheaper'

Negative Reviews:

---'the solution was to ship it back to amazon for a brand new replacement.it pains me to give this phone a bad review, but its the truth.' **** 'bad'
---'so take this short review with a grain of salt.the phone itself is great.' **** 'short'

__________('form', 'factor')__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.the s4 processor with two gigs of ram.the large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.the camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.the battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.the gesture controls are a very nice touch.the form factor is very sleek and sexy.now for a list of things i don't like quite as much.the power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.the signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless." **** 'nice'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i have 48gb of storage.- standard microusb cable for charging and data transfer- huge library of apps available from the store, most that i have downloaded are free- verizon, while being expensive, has the best coverage.cons- i wish the earphone jack was on the bottom.' **** 'available'
---'at first place, i thought its screen size looks good so continued to use it.but now it is given up and sold by trade-in.the character is not clear as iphone4s even though it has larger screen.every motion pictures driven by most of installed game apps go slow and unnatural when to see that is very different from what i got from iphone4s.quad core, big screen is outcome of scam of concerted advertisement by samsung and the world largest advertising company google.and it is very difficult to use when comparing with iphone4s in that i can restore my previous work into macbook and all bookmarks is not clearly recovered to use in the web browser of laptop with my google account and much more.camera is also shoddy compared with iphone4s.iphone5?' **** 'slow'

---'wicked.fully customizable....for sure.open android market  with lots of free apps that are not garbage.' **** 'free'
---"yes, with some work, some of the ugliness can be hidden (alternate launchers and other apps), but some stuff, like the archaic notifications shade, can't be ignored." **** 'other'
---"the xda forums is a great place to start!as far as any new apps that come with the s4, those are already available for rooted(and some non rooted) owners of the s3.the few reasons i can see to choose the s4 over the s3 are:form factor: the s4 is slightly better form factor (it's thinner with a larger screen), but the s3 feels really good in the hand and my pocket already for such a large phone!battery life: the s4 has better battery life than a stock s3 battery." **** 'new'
---'very dependable, fast, takes excellent photos, clear voice quality, tons of available apps, works seamlessly with google, etc.' **** 'available'
---'i left all the apps open during this testing time and the phone did not freeze it just got really hot and lagged a little bit when sending the text messages but that was all.' **** 'open'
---'tap into the google play store to load your favorite apps, and the siii feels and functions as good as or better than any desktop or laptop i have ever had.' **** 'favorite'

Negative Reviews:

---'they told me to go to verizon as it was past 30 days.' **** 'past'
---"it definitely makes in through a day without any problems, even with reasonably heavy use, but i've never been able to take it for two whole days without having to charge it up on day 2.  still, with a user replaceable battery, you could always keep a spare on hand and switch between the two if need be." **** 'whole'
---"after spending ten minutes with the phone, it's an obvious step up from the razr maxx and galaxy nexus--the former top tier android phones on big red's network.performanceas much as i loved my razr maxx (and its marathon 2-3 solid days of battery life), after spending a few minutes with the gs3, the performance leap is very noticeable." **** 'solid'
