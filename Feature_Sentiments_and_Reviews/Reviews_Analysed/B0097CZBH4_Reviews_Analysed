---"my galaxy s2 has removable battery and the casing goes back on as though it was never a removable battery to begin with.i know rubbish phones like motorola atrix 2, the back cover tends to feel flexible and wobbly giving it some nasty cheap feel but samsung has no problems with this you can't ever tell if its removable or not, its that sturdy.the reason i still buy a samsung phone and not other phones anymore is simply for the battery.secondly the iphone still uses ancient lcd display." **** 'removable'

__________('apple', 'products')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'new apple products are factory sealed hermeticamentes.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---"the technology is there, and would be a great improvement over the current system.a more robust design would be nice so that they didn't have to live in cases, and a dust and moisture resistant design would be very welcome.icloud is fantastic, and so i can't imagine changing phones to another manufacturer until someone else comes out with something at least as good as icloud.but when they do, i'll be more than happy to switch allegiance, despite twenty years as a loyal apple customer.apple can only push their customers so far, and i'm becoming more and more fed up with the way apple is treating it's customers with regard to their infuriating thinness campaign with their phones, ipads, macbook pros and imacs, at the expense of functionality and in a blatant attempt to corner the market and limit customers buying choices in terms of leads, adaptors, connections, music purchasing, app purchasing etc, as are many many other people.apple is a great brand and has produced many fantastic products, but the iphone 5 is not the leap ahead from the 4s that customers had hoped for, and this coupled with frustration and expense incurred by the connector design and the thinness over battery life and durability make it for me a 2 star product.if you own the 4s i'd suggest hanging on to it and waiting until autumn for the next hopefully much improved iphone, or samsung, or whoever the apple slayer will be." **** 'loyal'
