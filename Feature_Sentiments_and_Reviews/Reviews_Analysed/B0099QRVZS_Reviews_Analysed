__________('customer',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"they treat their customers like dirt.we then switched to virgin mobile, which didn't work out so well either due to bad connectivity and bad customer service (but not as bad as t-horrible, by any means...the main issue was being on hold for an hour to speak to someone in india, and usually subsequently getting disconnected)." **** 'bad'

Negative Reviews:

---'when i received the package, there were no seals on the box, there should be a seal on each side, it should also have a plastic film on the screen as well as the back of the phone, but the one on the back was missing and there was minor scratches on the back of the phone.when i took the plastic film off of the screen there were finger prints all over and the battery was not in a plastic bag as it was supposed to be, taking all of these things into consideration, it lead me to believe that someone opened this box and placed the battery into the phone probably out of curiosity, whatever the reason, someone clearly tampered with my phone scratching the back cover in the process.when i checked the log it showed that the phone was in use for over 5.5 minutes, apart from this, the phone seems to be in perfect working condition with no scratches on the screen whatsoever.my advice to you is to purchase from amazon or from a seller whose product is fulfilled by amazon in order for you to be covered by amazon.when amazon heard of my issue, they apologized for what happened and told me that products from other sellers that are fulfilled by them is from the sellers stock, and they promptly offered me a full refund so i can re-order, which i thought was great on their part, amazon always like to see their customer be happy with their purchase.i told amazon that i don\'t think that a full refund was necessary in this case as the phone works great otherwise so they offered my a 20% refund for the condition in which i received the phone, this i accepted as i consider this fair for all.please be careful who you purchase from, these phones are not cheap in any way, if you were to look at "techno.trading.house" seller\'s profile & feedback rating you will see mostly 5 star ratings which may give a false sense of security, make sure that your purchase is covered by amazon for your peace of mind.' **** 'happy'
