__________('area',)__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---'in fact i am cancelling my treo account and selling the phone because its so unreliable in every area it promises goods of.' **** 'unreliable'
---"), cheap now-a-days, video, flash camera, good reception (though that may be verizon's excellent coverage in the bay area), speaker volume can be set very high ... simple, clean design that does anything most folks will want.cons:-battery life leaves something to be desired (approximately 2.5 days with medium-heavy usage).-ringer volume is far too low for some situations with custom ringtones (preloaded ringtones are plenty loud).-newer phones have better color screens, but they are usually bigger, thicker, or more expensive.-pictures are not fantastic (though for caller id they are fine).-no pre-loaded games.there have been some people complaining about this phone in the reviews here, however, it seems that they either live in an area where verizon has poor coverage (usually it has excellent coverage relative to other carriers, but not everywhere) or they were expecting this phone to do more than any phone reasonably could." **** 'live'
