Negative Reviews:

---"smaller screen.pros:-the detailed resolution on the screen is phenomenal-okay sound for music with special dolby features-light weight-thin framed-durable screen-nice keyboard options-great processor at 1.5ghz-reasonable price at $199.99-if you love gaming you will love the emulators that will play with little to no problems-a fascinating led lit home button for notifications-shows great hd videos keyword is hd anything other than that is a bummer-great talk time battery life in between 15 and 17 hourscons:-internet is rather slow (my lg venice and f7 easily are neck and neck)-sometimes the keyboard would lag behind will trying to enter a website in the address box-it gets hot really quick- can easily slip out of your hands if your not too careful-the appearance lacks originality other than the led home button-little internal storage-no way of manually savings files to a micro sd card-the camera is to fuzzy but isn't the worst i have seen-while surfing the web battery life is just as bad as the other smartphones-speakers are of less quality than my lg venice which is roughly half the cost of the f7overall nice phone for discounted price but if it was for the initial asking price of $299.99 it would have been a 3 at best" **** 'best'
