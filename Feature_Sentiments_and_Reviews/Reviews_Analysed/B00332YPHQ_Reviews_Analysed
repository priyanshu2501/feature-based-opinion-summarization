---'i have been onto smartphones for a long time now, lately using nokia n97, nokia n95 before that (n73... on and on).the nexus one is not only far better than my nokia n97, it is imho opinion better than any other phone i have tried.i use it on t-mobile.' **** 'long'
---'the expense of sending it back to htc and being without a phone for an undetermined time period was enough to make me decide to pull the sim card and purchase another new unlocked phone (the samsung nexus s, which is even better than the google nexus one).of course, your mileage may vary.' **** 'undetermined'
---'when i saw the first few videos of people doing their unboxings and playing around with the interface for the first time, i knew i was in love.' **** 'first'
---'last month it started happening every single time i try to use the phone with the screen turned on (there seemed to be no problem when i used to talk on the phone, as the screen is turned off when i keep in near my ear,  or listen to music with the screen turned off), i couldnt even type out a message..i hit google again and looked for solutions to the problem, but i could find nothing.' **** 'single'

---"but it is annoying because typing is impossible at that time for about 5 min.-n1 has rather low internal storage, but i move most of downloaded apps to sd card so it is not too bad.-front face camera would be very nice, especially for skype video calls.-google voice app hangs up or refuses to send sms, but i am not sure if this is to be blamed on app developers or the phone manufacturer.this phone feels nice in hands and can be easily operated by one hand even if you are wearing gloves size s. despite its age it still doesn't give an impression of being slow, it is very responsive." **** 'impossible'

---'ota updatein google is just a bliss which you cannot find in any other google phoneswhere you have to take the phone to the service centre or to your operator to update the same.i have recently updated ota update to froyo 2.2.2 frg83 and im quite confident that 2.3 gingerbread updateis just round the corner, users can sit back and relax getting the update without any need to panic or togo to the operators and service centres for the same.i had purchased the phone from unlocked fones, my experience with unlocked fones was for the first time and i would rate the company to be excellent++ and i would strongly recommend anyone and everyone to buy fones from them.' **** 'first'
