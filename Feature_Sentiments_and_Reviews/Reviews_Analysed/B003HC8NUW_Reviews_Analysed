---'the phone has many pros which make the phone really likeable.pros--i have had a couple months to tinker with this phone and i have come to like the general feel of the user interface (htc sense), it seems to fit the phone and makes it more pleasing to look at.-- i found that being able to use the phone as a usb storage device is extremely convenient.--the camera is excellent, i have taken pictures of documents and they come out as extremely clear/readable (the flash is also a plus).--the video filming quality is good and seems to be above par from what is to be expected from a phone camera.--the availability of apps is convenient, whenever i need something like a pdf reader, or document reader or anything else, i just go straight to the market and find something that fits my needs.--battery life seems good (although some people seem to have had trouble with this)--phone call sound quality is pretty goodthis phone has some really annoying bugs which to a certain extent overwhelm the pros of the phone (for me anyway)cons--the phone is unable to connect to enterprise networks without lots of tinkering.' **** 'convenient'
---'to report these apps as inappropriate is futile since there are so many of them.' **** 'inappropriate'
---'you can use any song in your library as a ringer and there are free apps to help you edit those ringers.' **** 'free'
---'while it was working with wi-fi, it was extremely fast, the interface was lovely, there were many great apps, some better that the iphone, some not so much.' **** 'better'
---'the number of apps i have found are amazing...and best of all: most are free.' **** 'free'
---"i love how i can custom organize almost everything about my dinc, but making it so my phone will slow down due to unwanted apps running in the background--and ensure that i won't be able to stop them is not just a problem for htc, android and verizon, but something that i feel will force otherwise big fans of the google service off to something else entirely." **** 'due'
---'it really upsets me that when i use task manager to close specific programs, i find out later that certain apps re-started again all by themselves.hey verizon!' **** 'certain'
---'plenty of free apps.' **** 'free'
---"the android apps are pretty good - just not as plentiful, but on the other hand, not an overflow of the silly apps that available for iphone.i have had good luck with the verizon newtork (which is way more reliable than at&t; in my area), so i'm sticking with verizon and this is the best phone they've put on their network." **** 'good'
---'i downloaded free mah jongg, card games and other fun stuff from the free apps list.' **** 'free'
---"i got a 20% discount on the screen protector and the protective case because i bought them on the date that i purchased the phone.if you're on the fence and like to be able to get online whenever or like helpful apps, i say: do it." **** 'helpful'
---'half thefun though is exploring the vast amount of apps available for adroid, it is almost overwhelming.in summation, if you looking to move up to a smartphone you cannot go wrong with the droid incredible.of course you must commit to a 2-yr contract with verizon, but the trade-off is you get an amazingdevice for virtually nothing.' **** 'available'
---'=) also, i found that you can download apps that you can actually tether without the monthly free!' **** 'free'
---"=) i really want to be able to use apps that don't support htc sense." **** 'able'
---'there are a ton of great apps that are completely free.' **** 'free'
---"however, i have a microusb cable at work and at home, and i find that if i just put it on the charger whenever i am near my computer and let it charge overnight, that it lasts long enough to get me through those times when i can't charge it.to summarize:advantages of incredible over iphone:-verizon-open platform-customizable-app deployment/development-live widgets-full multitasking with any app-no itunes dependency and the ability to sync with multiple computersadvantages of iphone over incredible:-apps/app finding-ease of use/learning curve-battery life optimization-hd video shooting-better integrated multimedia apps (music, video watching, etc)-standardization (development for one platform vs. many platforms)note:  if i could rate amazon separately, i would give them infinity stars for getting me this phone." **** 'music'

Positive Reviews:

---"it has a wicked fast processor, a great camera and best of all, it's on verizon!" **** 'best'

Negative Reviews:

---"everyone keeps comparing it to the i phone but it can't compete.i have a co worker that owns a i phone and its nothing like the htc incredible the phone is fast and,have  thousands of apps, and a very nice camera, sounds great and i love the ringers.the wall papers on this phone is nice to." **** 'nice'
---'htc incredible droid is every thing i had read about, a user friendly type phone the market apps is great and the speaker mic for texting, looking up websites, e-mail, is great, the camera is very simple to use and great pictures.' **** 'simple'
---"if you aren't sold on the incredible, it may be to your advantage to wait and see more details on this phone to see if it fits your needs better.i guess i should probably say a few things about the incredible itself now - it feels great in my hands, is responsive when i move between applications and windows and has a very nice camera." **** 'nice'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"i like the phone too, but it is not incredible!i've had mine for 3 days now and have used it a lot (6 charges worth)cons: the camera sucks!" **** 'mine'
---"someone showed me this a couple days in, and it's very nice." **** 'nice'
---"it kept notifying me about messages i'd received days in the past - so i installed the brand new native twitter app and removed peep and all was well." **** 'past'
---'this is the fastest phone out on the market and i love going to websites that have flash, they show up perfectly.the market place is getting better, go get a task killing app or you will drain the battery, i have had the phone for 3 days now and it was very easy to pick up from the beginning you program the phone to the time you make a phone call.' **** 'easy'
---'seriously, phone pixel density is becoming so good these days that almost nobody can honestly see a measurable difference.' **** 'good'
---"that may even seem scary to some, but this device is really intuitive; after you use it for a couple of days, it's really easy and you understand it." **** 'easy'
---'after all this time, it has finally arrived and i\'ve spent the last few days playing with it.the number one question everyone will ask is "how does it compare to the iphone?"' **** 'last'

Negative Reviews:

---'the phone is very snappy and reliable, partly in thanks to verizon.the main con is that the battery is not going to last for days like it did on my flip-phone, before i decided i needed a smart phone for work, social, and play.' **** 'last'
---"it's acceptable if you properly condition the battery during the first 5-7 days of usage; after that time, i noticed my battery life almost doubled." **** 'first'
---"many messages seem to disappear from the app which is really strange.--the phone sometimes randomly freezes and restarts- so far it has happened to me twice (during the first two days that i had the phone).--the phone doesn't recognize new music without a restart- this problem is only with the phones native music app-others apps seem to have no trouble recognizing new songs.overall i like this phone, even with all of its issues (but that's probably because i live tinkering with tech and trying to figure out new ways to fix my tech problems)." **** 'first'
---'i leave them off except when i need them.now, it lasts about 3 days for average use.the other aspects are just like other reviewers say.' **** 'average'
---"i won't lie, you do need to be prepared to charge it daily, especially for the first few days." **** 'first'
---'and remember, something you can do with this and most every non-apple mobile device - easily carry a spare & swap / upgrade batteries.following the advice on the android forums, for the first few days i put my phone through full charge / discharge (till completely dead) cycles and have noticed a good 50% gain on battery life.the screen is gorgeous.' **** 'first'
---"better be before my 30 days are up, or i won't be there to receive it." **** 'better'

__________('a', 'better', 'battery')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i read a lot of reviews and it was scary waiting on my phone to see how it would make it through the day.for those of you torn between getting this phone and getting something with better battery life, good luck.' **** 'better'
---"and the standard battery on my moto q was awful, too, so i'm used to having to get a better battery." **** 'better'
---'if it shipped with a better battery it would get a 5 star easily!' **** 'better'
---'i suspect that the upgrade made the android os more efficient, thus the faster bench mark and better battery life.' **** 'better'
---"i swear she gets better battery life too, and i've really done my homework on ways to extend my battery life.as far as i can tell, the 1ghz processor is totally unnecessary." **** 'better'
---"the woman i spoke to at verizon is that they're working on getting a better battery for it, which makes it a bearable grievance.4 of 5 because honestly, the learning curve is insane going from a lg versa to a htc incredible and the short short battery life is maddening." **** 'better'
---'there has been a pretty fast and steady growth of homemade roms that really get the most out of the hardware and work towards getting better battery life.' **** 'better'
---'the battery could be better but with the battery saver app it gives me 2 extra hours of battery.' **** 'better'
---'?better yet, give us a bigger battery, htc already makes a 1500 mah, and a 3rd party makes 1750 mah batteries that fit.' **** 'better'

Negative Reviews:

---'i think if you give it a try not using it, you will have better battery use.' **** 'better'
---"?the phone has died on me at least 3 times for no apparent reason.i'm not happy about having to buy a more powerful battery, a better headphone and maybe some sort of shield to block the sunlight so i can use it outdoors????" **** 'powerful'
---"you can't travel anywhere without a charger, and afternoon conference calls from the road are dicey at best.my recommendation is to wait for a droid with better battery life!" **** 'better'
---'(but since its removable - you can buy extra)pros:it has fastest processor(for mobile) yet.. (but just like in netbooks vs laptopit may mean good response time vs battery time)it uses the latest android version 2.1( hopefully they should update it to upcoming 2.2which would give  it better battery life due to jit compiler)..it has inbuilt beta gps(works even when you talk), fm radio, awesome camera,decent camcorder and removable battery!it can be plugged to tv - per some youtube previews(i could not find that usb to composite video accessory- but since it has only 1 usb output- you will not be able to charge it while viewing the video)android has cool voice search facility.' **** 'better'

---"as much as i want better battery life--which apparently seems to be one of the many by-products for the incredible while using 2.2--i'm gonna wait 'til it arrives from verizon directly." **** 'much'
---'i looked at the droid phones, admiring this one and the droid x. i looked at the reviews and noticed there was sucky battery life for the incredible mostly, but i saw i can get a better battery.' **** 'better'
---"while noticeably inferior hardware-wise, it has the advantage of slightly better battery life and a physical keyboard, as opposed to the incredible's soft keyboard." **** 'better'

__________('calls',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"the problem was that at&t; didn't.for some time now i've been growing frustrated with dropped calls and lack of signal in places where i don't expect there to be a problem." **** 'dropped'
---"however, i had an iphone and really couldn't stand all the dropped calls and speed of the at&t network." **** 'dropped'
---'thanks to the line2 app that was on the app store, i was able to make calls with it on my ipod touch.' **** 'able'

Negative Reviews:

---"my calls don't seem to get dropped due to this, but if the phone thinks the signal is low it's going to use up more juice cranking up the data connection to compensate for the perceived signal strength.the phone also gets warm when in use." **** 'due'
