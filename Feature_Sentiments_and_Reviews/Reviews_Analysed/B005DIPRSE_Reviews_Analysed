---'it is a smart phone where i can have access to all email and social networks in one place and keep me informed.call quality is good, especially the speaker phone.the keyboard is very convenient since the touchpad is sometimes difficult to handle at the touch screen senciblethe camera takes excellent photos and applications load faster.all i can object to is the battery, which runs relatively fast.' **** 'convenient'

Negative Reviews:

---'said "goodbye" to my ol\' (not-sony) ericsson t39 with all its accessories, and have almost reached the top of my learning curve with this xperia pro.if anything, it has too much on the screen: i don\'t want embedded games and certain other stuff, but that\'s no big deal.i can use the slip-out keyboard without having to click-on the keyboard on my t39, and can read all my emails without having to boot-up my toshiba nb-100.' **** 'much'
---"(update: lockscreen has limited options, cannot launch apps unlike sense 3.0 and cannot control default music player from lock screen - possible to control music player from lock screen for replacement music apps like 'cubed')the keyboard has a nice feel to it - the space between the qwerty keys is adequate with just the right amount of travel (press feedback)." **** 'possible'

Positive Reviews:

---'the xperia pro boasts an 8 megapixel camera, complete with a single led light.' **** 'complete'
---'(update: music player has some limitations (like no repeat option - or may be i could not find it; can be replaced by any other android music app)(update: storage- comes wth 8gb class 2 microsd card)skype has the potential to utilize video calls - it starts up but closes when skype detects that device is not officially supported (i guess software restriction) - front camera resolution is ok.primary camera - tested only in low light - its good - day photos should be better, (8mp, hd video).curious thing - headset provided looks like sony proprietary.' **** 'low'
