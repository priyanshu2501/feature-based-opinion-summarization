---'it was done fast, in a couple of minutes, and the new number works perfectly without some stranger`s name showing up as me.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---'i have a new number and only 90 days of service because i had to buy another minutes card to reactivate my old phone.' **** 'new'
---"being an infrequent user, as i am, i find that having a year's service time remaining before any of my minutes expire, together w/ touchscreen, wifi, and triple minutes suits me, as an infrequent user, right down to the ground.i should add that the year's service time remaining with my phone doesn't come with it, but whenever you get a new phone, or install new minutes, you get an extra 90 days service time added to existing time, before any of your minutes expire; and if you transfer your number to a new tracfone, all your minutes and all or your service time are transferred as well; and of course with built-in double or triple minutes you get that as well." **** 'new'
