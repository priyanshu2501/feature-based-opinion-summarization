---"alas, i bought the phone anyway.upon receipt i noted the following: the side buttons are located on the screen half of the flip rather than the keypad half which is a departure from every other motorola phone i've had and, essentially, makes them utterly useless when in a call (changing volume for example would require you to pause the conversation to press the buttons); also, the battery cover for this phone is a cheap piece of plastic that may or may not fit all that well (mine took a bit of finagling to get it on); it comes questionably spare of accessories (at least from cingular)(for this price shouldn't it come with more than a home charger and useless keyfob).in the end, i returned the phone." **** 'other'

---"but i noticed everbody had the same phone, at least in my area..  i usually like to have something different.. so at first, i did buy the phone because most people didn't have it because of the price.. the sales person at cingular which had the v551 told me their was no difference but an internal antenna and less weight..  i've noticed the camera is a hell of alot better, plus the battery life is by far longer than the other phone...reguardless of area, the reception in almost crystal clear even in roaming or long-distance....i'll admit, i did buy it at first to have something different but i'm impressed with the features in comparison to the other phones i've owned..  if you have the $$$ buy it!!" **** 'longer'
---'battery life is good.' **** 'good'
---'once we got the phones i called back to check and yes the person from cingular had done everything as asked, i also checked from the phone itself as you can go to "my account" from the main menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.as far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, i can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, i don\'t recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and cingular "in my area" puts out a great signal.my wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away "with no roaming charges" btw our last cell phone service "alltel" would have been roaming within 20 miles.anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in "speaker phone" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, i put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a free call "mobile to mobile".we sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.she used the phone as her alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.i\'ve had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it "needs" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, so i\'m easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that\'s with a lot of fiddling around with it because it\'s new and 1-2 hours talk time.some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke.' **** 'likely'

---"here is what happened to mine over the past 10 days... the blue light keypad doesn't light up anymore (which makes it impossible to press number in dim light areas since the keypad is all flat), the phone doesn't tell me when i have a voicemail, nor does it tell me when i get a text message, and the phone seems to have a small delay when opening things, like when you used windows 98 back in the day, calls are dropped and the screen goes white and the phone resets still occasionally." **** 'white'

---'the only thing worth mentioning is the screen which is gorgeous truly impressive but still does not justify its price.' **** 'impressive'
---'the screen is clear and crisp (though if you are looking for a good imaging phone - look else where - may be sony ericsson k 750i), the key pad is nice (not cramped up) and the speaker phone is of good quality.' **** 'clear'
---'much to my dismay the screen is actually worse than the one on the v551.' **** 'worse'
---"when you zoom in, it simply crops the picture a little closer to the center so it doesn't have to scale as much to fit onto the screen." **** 'much'
---'someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do not do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.now myself i find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose "phone" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.i have only one complaint so far......the screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under "sunlight" is virtually unreadable.' **** 'nice'
---'this phone, while having a nice big screen, if very hard to work with.' **** 'hard'

---'once we got the phones i called back to check and yes the person from cingular had done everything as asked, i also checked from the phone itself as you can go to "my account" from the main menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.as far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, i can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, i don\'t recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and cingular "in my area" puts out a great signal.my wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away "with no roaming charges" btw our last cell phone service "alltel" would have been roaming within 20 miles.anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in "speaker phone" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, i put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a free call "mobile to mobile".we sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.she used the phone as her alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.i\'ve had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it "needs" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, so i\'m easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that\'s with a lot of fiddling around with it because it\'s new and 1-2 hours talk time.some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke.' **** 'average'
---'after 60 days, so far so good.' **** 'good'
---"here is what happened to mine over the past 10 days... the blue light keypad doesn't light up anymore (which makes it impossible to press number in dim light areas since the keypad is all flat), the phone doesn't tell me when i have a voicemail, nor does it tell me when i get a text message, and the phone seems to have a small delay when opening things, like when you used windows 98 back in the day, calls are dropped and the screen goes white and the phone resets still occasionally." **** 'past'
