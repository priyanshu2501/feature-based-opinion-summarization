---'moving on the phone now......pros of htc desire.great size.sturdy feel.hardware specs are great for the price.camera is up to par.amoled screen is superb.the htc sense ui is wonderfully easy to use.cons of htc desire, these are the make or break things for u, trust me.battery life is just average abt day and a half max with moderate to heavy use (samsung galaxy s i9000 is much much better, but so is the price i guess).internal memory sucks, jus over 150mb to store apps (didnt see this as a problem as i rooted mine and can store apps on the sd card).no folder support, u cant make folders in the ui, u have to attach to the computer as a sd card and manually create folders (not very user friendly in that aspect).no more android support, from what i have read, htc is only going to release support up to android 2.2 froyo so if ur looking for something more up to date software wise, need to get something else..just being petty i guess, but when in ur pocket, the speaker does not ring loud enough and u may have some missed calls.overall what sold me on this phone is the price, it was very reasonable for the hardware, even though ww had it a couple dollars extra, u pay for service which is no problem for me.' **** 'mine'
---'"starting download" is the hated message that is seen forever on the android market application.when we pay this sort of price for a damn phone we are not expecting to not even being able to download a simple free app, and if you search online for words such as "htc stuck on starting download" you will see how massive this problem is and for how long this has been around (single february at least) without a solution and with total disregard to the customers.' **** 'long'

Negative Reviews:

---'one minor problem  was the language setting.' **** 'minor'
---'not something i should of had to deal with right after taking it out of the box.the most significant problem, however, is lack of a 3g connection and no internet connection when outside a wifi hotspot.' **** 'significant'

---"the music player is very good, although it lacks an equalizer (i dont really miss it though, because music playback quality is good enough without eq when using a better pair of headphones than the standard - i'm using the klipsch image s4).i highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to steer clear of the control freaks at apple, without any sacrifices (look for the reviews around the web, some sites rate the htc desire higher than the iphone 4, and that means something)." **** 'higher'

Negative Reviews:

---"feature-wise, this phone is good.good web browser, good screen, acceptable music playback, excellent mail and calendar with google sync, facebook and twitter integration, and a bunch of apps to make it do pretty much anything.but i get about 8 hours out of a single charge, so i often run out of battery by 3pm.compared to my old nokia e71, which had nearly as many features, but would easily last 24 hours, the htc desire is a huge let down.and there are a bunch of poor design decisions: phone must be left on for alarm to work, can't check if phone is on/off without turning it on, can only have 4 browser tabs, need to have cellular coverage to use maps, etc, etc.i'll be jumping on the first android device with good battery life, but this phone leaves me wanting." **** 'good'
