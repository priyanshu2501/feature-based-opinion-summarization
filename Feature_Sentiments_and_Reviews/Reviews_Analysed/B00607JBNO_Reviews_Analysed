---"The reason I chose this phone was that it gave me all the apps I had on the iphone and more (although on an android platform), it's 4G and you can't beat $30 a month unlimited text, 4g up to 5g web and 100 minutes, (5g is more than enough), and NO contract, the phone is lightweight somewhat of a cheaper quality than the iphone, but then again it's not an iphone but functions just as well... the battery does drain a bit faster but you can get the juice defender to save on battery... don't like the bloatware but I saw in other reviews you can root to remove unwanted apps which is nice if the instructions are followed correctly without bricking the phone..." **** 'nice'
