---'being my first android phone, i asked other android users about stability and found their phones ran for weeks or months w/o issues.i found a firmware update on t-mobile site that was supposed to address "stability" issues[...] and was able to load it (android version 2.3.6 / software t679uvle1) manually using the samsung kies tool (ota update was no longer available from t-mob); however, it did not resolve the problem.' **** 'first'
---'i suppose these modifications carry some risk, but nothing bad has happened to me and i see lots of similar testimonials out there.with about 2 hours work i was rooted and another hour of uninstalling and my memory stays about 49% used if controlled by a good android ram manager (was as much as 90+ percent used before and most of it bloatware).' **** 'good'

Positive Reviews:

---'had it rooted to get rid of tmobile bloatware.' **** 'rid'

---'i have read and agree that its due to the bloatware clogging up the ram.' **** 'due'
---"it is a great phone for a very low cost; i bought it to use it in colombia and so far i had no issues with it; it is light, fast and it has a big screen that is good enought for the price point of this phone; one recommendation is to root it if you want to get rid of the t-mobile bloatware that comes integrated and get the best performance out of it; the only but so far has been the battery duration (it's kind of low compared to my previous samsung i5500), but i guess that it's a tradeoff for the bigger screen and the faster cpu." **** 'rid'
---'i actually rooted my phone and installed rebelrom (custom rom) and got rid of bloatware and transferred majority of apps to external sd card except voip apps (i kept voip apps in the phone sd to get better voice and video quality).' **** 'rid'

Positive Reviews:

---'upon checking the phone, i see that i could not use the touch screen, i forced a shutdown, and after numerous attempts to force a reboit ( i held the power button for many many seconds) it did turn on after abt five tries!now i was warned prior to looking for a new phone.other notables:screen reacts to daytime light in a bad way, u have to be inside to see the screen as it is a virtual mirror when outdoors.small keypad makes for slow data entry and errorsvoice feature offsets the keypad issue above.' **** 'slow'
---'so far, im really liking the samsung exhibit ii, used on the t-mobil "pay as you go" plan.. i got the phone, bought 25$ of minutes, then went in and turned off the "use packet data" feature, so i wouldn\'t incur the daily "data" fees normally associated with a smartphone.. im almost always near a wifi, and use that to do all my surfing, updates and downloads.. if im ever in a situation where i need the internet/data away from a wifi, i can quickly turn packet data on, and do what i need to do via the $1.50 unlimited data per day, that t-mobil offers.. as for the phone itself, the only gripe i have is the battery.. seems to only last around 8 hours before it\'s wanting a recharge, and i use the phone very little.. hope to look into some apps to help that out in the near future.. the camera is also very good imo, and the led flash is also a nice perk.. im not the most savy of smartphone users, but from my limited experience i\'d recommend this phone to anyone!' **** 'daily'

---'so far, im really liking the samsung exhibit ii, used on the t-mobil "pay as you go" plan.. i got the phone, bought 25$ of minutes, then went in and turned off the "use packet data" feature, so i wouldn\'t incur the daily "data" fees normally associated with a smartphone.. im almost always near a wifi, and use that to do all my surfing, updates and downloads.. if im ever in a situation where i need the internet/data away from a wifi, i can quickly turn packet data on, and do what i need to do via the $1.50 unlimited data per day, that t-mobil offers.. as for the phone itself, the only gripe i have is the battery.. seems to only last around 8 hours before it\'s wanting a recharge, and i use the phone very little.. hope to look into some apps to help that out in the near future.. the camera is also very good imo, and the led flash is also a nice perk.. im not the most savy of smartphone users, but from my limited experience i\'d recommend this phone to anyone!' **** 'daily'
