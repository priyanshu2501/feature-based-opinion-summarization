---'well, i am a new bb user, always using nokia, so i knew i could have some problems related to "usability", but it has been not a ver hard learning curve.pros:- nice graphical interface (dual touch and things like that)- the keyboard works great- it has a concept where all the things are combined, like linkedin, facebook, and the normal people directory- i have my business stuff there- even it doesn\'t sound great, it plays music (with phones) decently- the internet navigation works very well- the camera works decently, but for me is not my main camera so i\'m fine with thatcons:- it could have a better screen resolution- the integrated speaker doesn\'t have a great bass, and they are not stereo (my previous phone was a nokia xpressmusic 5800, and its speaker sounded great to be a phone)- the screen, when unlocked, seems to be very sensitive- i though the xpressmusic battery lasted too short, 2 or 3 days, but this one is drained in 1 to 1.5 days with normal use (two e-mail accounts + fb + linkedin + phone, all on line, having deactivated bluetooth and wifi)as a closing line, i should say that is a great business phone, and a normal-use phone too.update: i suspect that the bb holster is the reason i have a "decent" battery performance compared to others:[...]' **** 'better'
