---"Pros:- Nice graphical interface (dual touch and things like that)- The keyboard works great- It has a concept where all the things are combined, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and the normal people directory- I have my business stuff there- Even it doesn't sound great, it plays music (with phones) decently- The internet navigation works very well- The camera works decently, but for me is not my main camera so I'm fine with thatCons:- It could have a better screen resolution- The integrated speaker doesn't have a great bass, and they are not stereo (my previous phone was a Nokia Xpressmusic 5800, and its speaker sounded great to be a phone)- The screen, when unlocked, seems to be very sensitive- I though the Xpressmusic battery lasted too short, 2 or 3 days, but this one is drained in 1 to 1." **** 'better'
