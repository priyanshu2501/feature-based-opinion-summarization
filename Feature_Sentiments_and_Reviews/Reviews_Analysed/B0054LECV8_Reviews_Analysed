Positive Reviews:

---'this new camera button is a stragely welcome addition, more on that in a sec, but you should be aware that it can also greet your palm with a harsh scrape every now and then, as well.' **** 'new'
---"the form is nice: slimmer than the evo 4g.there's also a separate camera button, a piece of sensibility many manufacturers are coming back to.the 3d photo and video capability does nothing for me." **** 'separate'
---'the camera is too slow.' **** 'slow'
---'the 5mp duel camera is very good for any type of pictures and the auto focus and face recognition works a treat.i totally recommend this phone.' **** 'good'
---'my next phone will be the moto photon because it has just about the same specs without the 3d, gsm for overseas travel and better camera....plus the new motoblur is supposed to be much more like sense.9.' **** 'better'
---'the 5megapixel camera is actually quite good if you know what your doing.' **** 'good'
---"both are capable of 720p video, which is plenty in my opinion, but the actual camera sensors aren't as good which is why the contrast and detail in pictures and video is noticeably worse than on the sgii and ip4." **** 'actual'
---'the 2d is also quite nice, though, and a 5mp camera seems fine to me.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---'according to htc the kickstand was sacrificed in order to accommodate the larger battery and double camera lenses.' **** 'double'
---"since the 3d photos utilize two camera lenses instead of one, there's more detail to find in the background and foreground than if originally taken in 2d (which only uses the top camera)." **** 'top'

---'pro:evo3d is the successor to the widely successful htc evo 4g that launched on sprint  in 2010. this phone has a better screen (higher resolution, better contrast), better processor (qualcomm s3 as opposed to s1 in the original) better battery life (compared to evo 4g) and is running gingerbread with sense 3.0. the only thing missing from evo3d that was available on the original evo is the stand which you can get if you buy a (specific) cover.' **** 'successful'
---'finally the new sense from htc is the best interface i have seen on a phone to date!cons: no built in kickstand, however a case with a kickstand is in the works.' **** 'new'

Positive Reviews:

---"the main feature of the phone is the camera, so i'd expect a recessed groove or something." **** 'main'

---'htc added a new feature to the pull down menu to where you can quickly cut off things like wifi, mobile network, blue tooth, etc.' **** 'new'
---"as for gps (used with the included maps application), it holds up pretty well and, if driving, should be able to pick up on your general area quite quickly.probably the phone's most touted and interesting feature, however, is the inclusion of 3d photo/video capturing and playback." **** 'interesting'

Negative Reviews:

---'when you pull down the drawer from the top of the screen and touch "quick settings" at the bottom, there is an option that reads, "total memory".touch "total memory" to open a list of currently running programs which you can move to the sd card... here you can also stop select programs from running, or touch the "kill all" button on the bottom to shut off everything that is listed, this is another great accessible feature that will do well on its on without the need for a third party task killer.the qhd screen is very responsive and great for web browsing.' **** 'accessible'
---"as far as 3d is concerned it's good feature and not just gimmick." **** 'good'
---"that said i am not completely satisfied with 3d feature but that's probably just me expecting more advanced 3d since i am not completely satisfied with my panasonic plasma 3d also." **** 'advanced'
---'i can honestly say this is the only feature i truly hate on the phone.overall i highly recommend this phone and i am very satisfied with the purchase.' **** 'hate'
---'personal significant use: android g1 -> iphone 3gs -> htc evo 4g 3d(also toyed with many other android devices and iphone 4)this device is easily my favorite.for me, the 3d is a significant feature set.photos and videos display on my nvidia nvision active shutter 3d desktop without conversion.everyone (unexpectedly) loves the 3d features (literally everyone, except one person who had some kind of oculo-muscular surgery of some kind and could not see it)' **** 'significant'

---'the green hornet wasn\'t that great of a movie, but i digress.===== other thoughts on 3d =====the 3d features of the evo 3d may feel a bit gimicky to some, but that\'s likely only because of the small viewing "sweet spot" due to it being glasses-free technology.' **** 'green'

---'free 3d spiderman game, 3d green hornet movie and 3d youtube videos round out the main moniker of the phone and are fun to play with - but the real value of 3d is seeing 3d pictures of your family for the first time that brings a whole new perspective to your personal photos.highly recommended.' **** 'green'
