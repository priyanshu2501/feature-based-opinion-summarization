__________('price',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i guess i should not have expected so much from this sony since the price is so low, but i did.' **** 'low'
---'the price is perfect.' **** 'perfect'
---"great phone for the price.lots of features and good battery duration, even with wifi or gps active, my previous phone couldn't last half day with wifi always on (it was an old phone so i dont know what is the expected battery life for a current model)though the size is not the smallest it is very light.the dual sim works better than expected, can receive calls in any of the sims (one at a time) without switching.the only negative points are related to performance, but again: its a very low price for a good device with dual sim support and ics." **** 'low'
---'i have for 2 months no complains, its a good little phone for a good price, i bought for my son and he really likes.' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"i bought the xperia because i can't get my hands on a nexus 4 at a reasonable price and needed something in the interim as my old phone died.some reviews talk about the phones' small size." **** 'reasonable'
---'for the price it is an excellent telephone... it is not a gs3.. but if, me wanted a gs3 will buy me a gs3.... it is not also possible to compare against other telephones that double the price.... in this range of price it is the best.' **** 'best'

__________('time',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'on the internet, you can find info on the best deals for individual countries, ahead of any travel.when first time abroad, in china, and still lacking experience, i ran into a problem with the data service on the phone.' **** 'first'
---'first time look like ok, later, its slow for do a phone call, and in 3 months i see, nobody in my list contacts!!!!!' **** 'first'
---'this was a waste of time and much more expensive than doing it in france at an orange store (i know b/c i went to the orange store in paris).' **** 'expensive'
---"i can usually go without a charge for at least three days as i don't use apps for long periods of time (less than a hour a day), and i tend to keep my wi-fi off unless i need it to browse the web.price: for a mid-tier dual-sim phone, the tipo is fairly priced, and strikes a good balance between its price and the features offered.screen issues: the tipo's screen doesn't respond very well in cold weather, and it sometimes glitches and misinterprets the user's input - especially if you opt to use the pattern screen lock feature." **** 'less'

Negative Reviews:

---'i also travel to germany frequently for business and one of my us and one german sims..the good:- pretty good battery life with medium usage- compact- running android ics- free tethering on att- dual sim- pricethe bad:- plasticy- limited hardware means choose your apps carefully- screen is small and low quality- not the smoothest execution of androidi set up the phone with key productivity apps only and a few games that run well with limited hardware resources so i can be productive and have some easily accessible time wasters when on the road .' **** 'accessible'
---'this may sound worrisome, but i discovered a quick fix for these screen glitches - simply press the power button on top of the tipo twice, and the screen issue should resolve itself immediately.music library issues: the default music library takes an extremely long time to compile its internal memory after adding a song to the phone, regardless of whether the song is stored on the phone itself or stored on a memory card.' **** 'long'

Positive Reviews:

---'tethering off the phone works fine for the data speeds characteristic for my location, both through usb and wifi.the cramped keyboard makes it tight to type.' **** 'characteristic'
---"i just used one sim card per phone on this trip, but if you were driving though different countries in europe or wanted a separate data provider, you might want to have dual sim cards.if i didn't need dual sim cards, i would just go with the lg phone b/c it had all the functionality i needed at the lowest cost." **** 'separate'
