---'this phone is very durable and nice, not very big easy to carry anywhere, has all the features that make it a very useful phone.' **** 'easy'
---'therefore, i have to recommend that american customers stay away from this phone: despite its nifty feature set, there\'s just too much risk of things going wrong, and unless you\'re a mobile techie, it\'s a major headache trying to fix the bugs (assuming they even can be fixed).first and foremost, tmob doesn\'t have proper configuration settings for this phone; instead, they sent me settings for a "similar" phone, and when problems started to crop up, they told me those were the only settings available.although i\'m still sorting some of these problems out (and may eventually fix most or all of them), it\'s been a major hassle so far, and one not hinted at in the many professional and amateur reviews i read before buying this model, most of which were very positive about its features and realistic about its limitations.' **** 'positive'
