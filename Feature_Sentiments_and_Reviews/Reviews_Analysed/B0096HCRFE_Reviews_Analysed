Negative Reviews:

---"This is my first android powered phone and I have to say it is amazing from Pandora to Facebook, its interface the active backgrounds are great, the phone can do everything I need, the only thing I can complain it doesn't do is tether (create a wifi hotspot)but I don't really need it to do so, I think the reason people have rated it so low on here is because they haven't done their research its a pre paid phone its not like its going to have a 10 megapixel camera, the price should not be an issue do your research and find a deal online, at the end of the day if your ready for a nice android phone that can have a wealth of internet possibilities get this phone, if you want the best phone on the market with every feature you can possibly have, don't buy this phone" **** 'first'
