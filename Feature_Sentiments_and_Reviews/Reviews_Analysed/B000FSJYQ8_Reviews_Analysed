---"the radio works well, although the earbuds are hard to use when you get sweaty at the gym (or at least for me...they keep falling out)the camera is a nice to have feature because i can't very well take my huge clunky, professional camera with me when i go to the irish pub down the street." **** 'nice'

---'i rarely use it as i use a regular camera.' **** 'regular'
---"* 3g.apparently there aren't any phones out there that can match the w810i (i had bought it for $500 in 2006) at the same price, and yet offer me a better camera, wifi, gps and 3g.yeah - probably the iphone." **** 'better'
---"it's not just a phone, it's also a digital camera, e-mail client, web browser and personal organizer." **** 'digital'
---'with the exception to the scratches, it still works great.the bad side of this phone..the size of the screen is too small to browse the web comfortably, if you want fast internet you will not get it with this, cannot stream video from the web, the camera is not good in low lighting because the flash is weak.' **** 'good'
---"pros:  excellent sound and environment noise isolation ( far better than ipod ), easy and fast switch between walkman / phone / radio  mode, good screen can be used outdoor with no problem, easy bluetooth configuration, insuperable easy to use pc-like menus uses tabs for item organization ( calls, contacts, options and so on ) good camera / accesory light, good photo camera quality, acceptable video capture ( yet can't replace any digital camera ) easy in-out memory stick dos not need to turn off phone, comes with usb pc cable and 512mb." **** 'digital'
---'i\'m not sure how the "my friends" works which has apparently replaced the im/chat section, so i will have to look into that.the camera is very nice, one would expect a 2mp camera to be better than vga so i can\'t see how anyone would complain about that, and so far it hasn\'t disappointed.' **** 'nice'

---"at 2mg resolution you wont be taking pictures worth enlarging to 8x10 but as a 'point n shoot' camera for general use it more then does the trick and the resulting images are pretty good in the 4x6 size range.the call quality i have experienced has been quite good, even in the speaker phone mode, with an average talk time of around 2.5 - 3 hours continuous call and i have gone up to 4 days without needing to charge the phone under very minimal usage conditions.truely, the only thing i have an issue with is that the plug-in port for the charger and the ear phones are one and the same meaning that you can't have the phone plugged in to charge and use the radio feature at the same time since it's the ear phone wire that serves as the radios antenna.overall i would definitely recommend this phone to just about anyone whether you're looking for a new phone, a new mp3 player or even a new point-n-shoot digital camera, especially if you're a traveler and need to lighten you accessory load." **** 'new'

Positive Reviews:
