---'turns out to be a pretty good camera and i have been happy with all the pictures i took!+ bluetooth speed and performance - the bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.cons:- runs somewhat warmer than past android phones - due to a larger processor and faster processor, this requires more use of the battery causing the battery to heat up more and the battery to drain faster than say the older s3 mini, s3, s2 etc.' **** 'past'

Negative Reviews:

---"the title say &#34;samsung galaxy s4 mini gt-i9190 unlocked international version - white&#34; and i have to say it is not the 9190, it is the 9192, basicly the same phone but dual sim, at first i was upset because it wasn't what i bought, but i'm from an other country and it took long time to sent the phone to me, so it wasn't easy to send it back right away because i'm going to usa in march, so i thought that i should not make a big deal out of it... so i was happy with it, and it is actually a very good phone, perfect size, good screen, i love android (i had a windows phone before, it was good but now i think a prefer android), but what really bothered me was that when i turned on the phone and was putting my settins, specificly the google account (pretty much the most important one) it just collapsed, i spend a whole day trying to do the that so i could use the phone properly (download apps from the market for example) and i just couldn't, i even had to do a hard reset to the phone, that one pressing the home button+volume up+power button, and then it let me do all  the settings... it works great but every 2 days o once a day it shut down, and a had to start it again, or it simply reset itself... i really dont know why, if its a refurbished peace (it doesn't seen like it was), i havent istalled a lot of things, basics stuff (and candy crush of couse lol), but i really cant say what the problem is...conclusion, be carefull because you may not get what they are saying (gt-i9190)" **** 'good'
