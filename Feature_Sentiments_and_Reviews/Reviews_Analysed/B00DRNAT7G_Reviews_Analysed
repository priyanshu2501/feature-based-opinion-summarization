---'the phone works very well outside us with a non us sim card.it is small, light, has a beautiful clear and loud sound on both sides.its screen resolution is very good and enough for its dimensions.the processor is fast and the battery is sufficient for 2 days whenthe device is not used for playing music or with bluetooth or wifi on.the phone does not have any notification leds, like its bigger brother, the s4.in general, i would recommend it to anyone that has good eyes and do not requirea very high end device with a lot of apps.' **** 'good'
