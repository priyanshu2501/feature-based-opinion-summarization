---'think hard before you choose this phone if you have to deal with htc "non-support" you are in trouble next time anything elseupdate after cell hell htc finally did what they should have done in the first place replaced the phone and they phone works without any problems' **** 'trouble'
---"it's a little big and heavy, but once you get used to the size you'll have a hard time going back." **** 'hard'
---"the only cons i would mention are the battery cover and the bloatware att installs on your phone and won't let you remove (unless you root the phone).if you've never used android before, there is a small learning curve - but you went through that when you used a computer for the first time as well:-) embrace the change, and you will be surprised at how much more you can do with this phone." **** 'first'
---'the first time, after having this phone 4 days, people could not hear me when i called.' **** 'first'
---"i have not felt this shocked by a electronic device since i used the internet for the first time in 1995.  it is not as idiot proof as apple's operating system though." **** 'first'

Positive Reviews:

---"side-by-side comparison with an iphone and there's no contest.- battery life's not exactly impressive, but not a hassle by any means.- the plastic door to the battery is disturbingly flimsy, which makes me feel crankier about the battery.- the npr app blows compared to the iphone equivalent- it's a little weird that android phones need an app killer, though i don't really mind this.- app store even sloppier and full of more useless crud than apple's." **** 'flimsy'

Positive Reviews:

---"i hope the newer revisions of android comes with a better interface.for listening to music, i was so used to the itunes playlist feature and the phone doesn't provide something comparable out of the box, but the songbird app seems to fill in the void (i'm sure there are other apps out there that provides the same feature/functionality).the battery life is a joke." **** 'other'
---'i\'ve had the chance to (unsuccessfully) root my phone and (successfully) sideload apps.here\'s few more things to get the most out of your device:- check gizmodo for "the best apps" (updated every month)- there are guides to install sideloaded apps (workaround at&t;\'s block, to install .apk files), apps from the amazon app store, and swype - all are available on android central forums.' **** 'best'
---'the phone is very customizable and there are so many new apps being added all the time.' **** 'new'
---"i did spend most part of the weekend (much to my wife's chagrin) understanding and configuring the phone (downloading apps, music, contacts, etc." **** 'music'
---'the fact that none of these apps is necessary because google has provided apps that do all the same things just makes it more absurd.the battery life is lame for a phone, but great for a laptop/camera/mp3 player/phone replacement.' **** 'google'
---'referring back to applications, there are many free apps offered in the android market for productivity and entertainment; while i use very few of them, the inspire did not have any trouble with lagging during any application i ran.' **** 'free'
---'the phone does come with lot of htc and at&t; junk which cannot be removed.i love android over ios but loved the apple hardware over htc.pros:1. super fast phone - all apps open in a snap2.' **** 'open'
---'i had to get used to all the features and free apps it has and i am constantly asking myself "what can\'t this phone do?' **** 'free'
---"i have it as an app on my screen, i hit the button, say what i want to look up and it's usually right.the market has so many free apps, i haven't paid for one app yet!the touchscreen keyboard took about a week to get the hang of.plug in your headphones (not included) and you have an instant mp3 player and fm radio - you just saved $100-300!i could not be happier!the only negatives i can possibly think of is that the battery installation is really, really hard." **** 'free'
---"ok i really need some help o really want this phone but i need to know how to side load apps can anyone teach me can i'm new to the world of smart phones and when i watch videos on youtube they never actually show you the steps they just say all this stuff that i don't understand can someone please help me would greatly appreciate it.my email is clintonnewman19@yahoo.com" **** 'load'
