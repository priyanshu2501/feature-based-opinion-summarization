---"i just got this phone... and as of now.. im not having big problem on itim writing this review using the phone itself... lets begin with the speed... speed is great... i never encounter lagging yet... changing from one apps to another is fast and smooth... it can also handle lots of apps in the same time as it can do multi tasking.... touch screen is very nice... good resolution.. with resistive touchscreen.. u cant even tell if its if really resistive.. the responsiveness of the screen is good.. apps... well its a open source os.. and when you setup the download section of the phone.. u have hundreds and going to thuosand free apps... very nice phone.. i tried to down load irreco for n900.. and ur phone can be a UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL  on tv.. and other appliances... web browser is the best feature... there's nothing i can say with it.. very useful for me.. coz i can even do my homework online using this.. or even making document files and presentation... camera and video.. not very impressed with the camera... for me n97 has better camera quality than this.. but its almost the same.. maemo os.. well if your new on it.. u'll find it hard to set up some stuffs... but it will give you a real computer experience... with the panorama desktop.. it a nice place to put all ur apps... tv out is nice feature of this while ur surfing the internet or watching a movie.. it shows a nice picture resolution on a 50 inch hdtv... very clear... there are some issue with os.. but i have no worries on that because with just an update it will bw fixed... when ur using the browser the use of the volume button is zoom in and out.. so u need to go on the desktop and adjust the volume... on some items.. that need to be tapped twice to openn.. with just one tap its opening... theres only two prfile and its general and silent... keyboard is very nice.. its easy to type on it.. well i dont want to waste time typing here if it is not... stylus is long enough.... i used t own an iphone and still having my n97.. well this a better phone than both.. but still there are some feature that this phone behind on the two.. so if ur planning to buy this phone... i recommend this to all of you... and just clear things up.. this is not a phone, smartphone, this is a internet tablet that just happen to make call and sms.. but for me its not a internet tablet either.. its a pocket size computer..." **** 'free'

---"So hold your horses for an explosion of apps very soon.. Cons:- It has a resistive screen and not capacitive so the responsiveness is not as much as the iPhone but hey, I can use a stylus... and not have to take my gloves off in COLD WINTERY DAYS!- Email client is iffy, Does not support Exchange 2003 yet but only Exchange 2007 - (an update is in the process to fix this)- Yahoo push email service is missing - I could not get folders to show up but just the inbox was able to load- Except the phone (which works in both portrait and landscape modes) everything else works only in landscape modes and again a Nokia update supposedly before the end of the year is going to fix this !- Very limited apps at this point- Weight and size - but again don't compare this to the iPhone which is stunted in features but only good on Apps that are free and mostly games!!" **** 'free'
