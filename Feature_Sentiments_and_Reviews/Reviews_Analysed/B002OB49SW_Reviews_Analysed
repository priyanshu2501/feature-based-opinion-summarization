Positive Reviews:

---'the full keyboard is very good.' **** 'good'
---'resistive is also great for selecting small objects ( ever try selecting something small on the iphone it\'s a pain ) with the stylus or using the handwriting program so you can actually write notes on the screen ( can\'t do that with iphone or android ) with your own handwriting.physical keyboard is small but you don\'t feel squished when needing to use it to type ( virtual keyboard can also be used via the screen ).turn by turn, voice navigation is coming via sygic in about a week so no more "oh the phone doesn\'t have voice navigation" crap.everything else:the processor itself is capable of 1ghz ( so technically just as fast as the snapdragon ) but is capped at 680mhz to preserve battery and reduce heat, but the processor itself with 1gb of ram means this baby is fast and damn do i mean fast!i bought a class 6 16gb micro sdhc a while back so i bumped the storage in this thing to 48 gb ( ofc not 48gb total because of os storage just like any other smartphone ) more than any iphone or android user...  :pthis is the phone for geeks and nerds and the only phone that\'s linux, open, and in all actuality a computer first, phone second but it\'s also a phone that will appeal to the normal user because of it\'s accessibility and user friendly interface.what other phone can run full html google voice and wave via the browser and not having any slow issues...nothing, except the n900!' **** 'small'

---'another word of advise if you plan on buying a carrying pouch get one without magnets, because everytime i bought a case in which used magnets to secure the device in the pouch it would unlock the phone, and thats primarily caused by the magnetic switches that are used to tell the device whether the keyboard is open or not.' **** 'open'

---"the keyboard is by far the best i've used (compared to other nokias, other manufacturers, including physical and virtual keyboards).i do prefer a slimmer phone, but this phone has convinced me to get the next maemo/meego phone rather than android or iphone (depending on price of course) as my next phone." **** 'best'

---"it also wouldn't hurt if they just placed the memory card slot at sim card slot at the back of the screen for easier accessibility like the htc kaiser...pros:* programs open really fast* screen is sharp and bright* virtual keyboard is very finger friendly* built is great* great os and very promising* built in microb browser and firefox beta 5 for maemo eats all those gimmicky browsers out there alive* 1700 mhz 3g (yehey for me!!!" **** 'sharp'
---'* no mms without a 3rd-party app (and then not integrated with sms)* no isync without a 3rd-party app* usb charging won\'t work from most "dumb" chargers, such as lighter-to-usb or batteries* no distinctive ringtones* no voice dialing* gps lock takes several minutes, if at all* maps application is total junk, even if gps locks* will not sync with older versions of exchange server* contacts with both a name and a company can\'t easily be searched on company* resistive touchscreen requires a stylus for most interactions and is much harder to use than the iphone or andriod phones* battery life relatively poor (i have to charge during the day if i use the browser)* fm transmitter (for car radio) close to uselesson the upside, the qwerty keyboard is an essential for me, the camera is good, the browser is functional, and it has flash (thought not flash 10).while pr1.2 update has improved some usability in many areas, the os appears to be a dead end for nokia, as their current releases are going with the symbian line again.' **** 'essential'
---"(can't beat the almighty n82's xenon flash).music playback is really good.speakers are loud and clear and you can also use any headphones you want to really enjoy your mp3's.video playback is excellent both on the phone's screen and also while using tv-out.this thing plays the most common video formats without the need to convert.you just drag and drop your videos from you pc and enjoy them.what really impressed me was the transfer speed for files when connected via mass storage.it's really fast.this is why i like nokia - no i-tunes here.only freedom.the hardware keyboard is really good and i got pretty big fingers.the touchscreen keyboard is great also.the phone has a solid build and it has a very sexy design i might say.not really thin but it's so powerful you won't think about size.the gps i don't use as i have a standalone unit but it's good to know it's there.from what i understand the n900 will be able to run the meego os when it comes out so i'd say it's also future-proof.one of the few things that i don't like about it is that at the moment it doesn't have portrait mode (except for photo gallery,the phone app and the browser)it will be added in the near future hopefully.also it doesn't have mms natively.you have to install an app to send and receive mms.personally don't use mms but i just want to know it's there.at the moment the apps for the n900 are few but even so (for me at least) this device already does everything i expected from it.such is it's power.overall i love this minilaptop as i like to call it.if you want power and freedom the n900 is for you." **** 'good'

---"it has it's advantages to the weight, such as the grand 32gb internal memory with optional 16gb increase.now onto the con's, which contain both cold hard facts about the phone as well as some minor annoyances.keyboardall right it doesn't count because i knew it was three rows before i purchased it but it could have been a lot more functional, it misses a whole lot of keys and because of this means that many keys are only available on the on-screen keyboard, and there are also keys that are missing from there (search for the ~ and let me know if you find it)responsivenessthis is probably the biggest complaint i have on this phone." **** 'minor'

---'resistive is also great for selecting small objects ( ever try selecting something small on the iphone it\'s a pain ) with the stylus or using the handwriting program so you can actually write notes on the screen ( can\'t do that with iphone or android ) with your own handwriting.physical keyboard is small but you don\'t feel squished when needing to use it to type ( virtual keyboard can also be used via the screen ).turn by turn, voice navigation is coming via sygic in about a week so no more "oh the phone doesn\'t have voice navigation" crap.everything else:the processor itself is capable of 1ghz ( so technically just as fast as the snapdragon ) but is capped at 680mhz to preserve battery and reduce heat, but the processor itself with 1gb of ram means this baby is fast and damn do i mean fast!i bought a class 6 16gb micro sdhc a while back so i bumped the storage in this thing to 48 gb ( ofc not 48gb total because of os storage just like any other smartphone ) more than any iphone or android user...  :pthis is the phone for geeks and nerds and the only phone that\'s linux, open, and in all actuality a computer first, phone second but it\'s also a phone that will appeal to the normal user because of it\'s accessibility and user friendly interface.what other phone can run full html google voice and wave via the browser and not having any slow issues...nothing, except the n900!' **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"mouse emulation works a little strangely, with taps on the screen not seeming to consistently register mouse-clicks in the same place you tapped, but keyboard emulation is surprisingly comfortable, although the n900's lack of a full pc keyboard means that you may have to make some compromises in terms of key emulation if you're planning to play a flight simulator which has hundreds of active gameplay keys.going beyond everyday usage and looking at the overall craftsmanship of the n900, the device feels sturdy and solid; it is slightly thicker than a typical smartphone on the market today (probably partly because of the inclusion of built-in stereo speakers), but not significantly heavier." **** 'typical'

Negative Reviews:

---'as result, this phone can be properly used only on its widescreen orientation, which is great for texting and instant messaging, but it sucks hard when you\' ve got to look for a contact and call him.my final consideration is that this phone is worth buying if you\'re not an "intensive caller", because after a while it\' ll drive you a bit mad with its horizontal configuration(the only moment in which the interface is vertical is when you close it right before the phone call).it doesn\' t have only cons though: the interface is original and very nice to see and use, you just have to take some time to get used to it.the keyboard is probably my favourite part, it\' s freaking comfortable, way better than on-screen ones, it made me almost forget i was not using a laptop to chat.the other nice thing is the operating system: you\' ve got a full-featured linux distribution running on it, therefore you\'ve got access to some of the most well-known software: firefox, xchat, pidgin and so on; the default browser is by far the best one i\'ve ever tried on a mobile device(also thanks to the keyboard).an impression i had is that sometimes the whole system suffers a bit because of the cpu speed, which should be ~600mhz, but it\'s acceptable, the only thing is that it\'s not as fluid as an iphone.to sum up everything, i think this is a good phone for a geek(also because of nice qt development environment), but i wouldn\'t recommend it to the average user.' **** 'whole'

---'to my greatsurprise, i have discovered it was super easy to use - kind of iphone with keyboard,but with many additional, very attractive hardware features:- 5 mp camera that makes great photos and high resolution videos (hd) and has dual-diode flash, this alone being a major feature to embarass iphone crowd.- fm transmitter that allows you to listen any music, internet radio etc.' **** 'attractive'

Negative Reviews:

---'i leave the phone locked on 3g (it\'s available in whole nyc and yonkers), playing internet radio over 3g is pretty enjoyable, way better than "local" fm stations.since the phone has that powerful hardware and high-res screen, you can expect battery time is short, i manage to get 3.5 hours of streaming audio over 3g without turning screen on halfway, the battery goes a lot shorter if you keep screen lit no matter it\'s online or not.internet performance: the phone is backed by 10.8/2.0 hspa, i even got 5mbps with t-mobile, which is the best phone for tethering, bt tethering is not available out of the box and the add-on is flaky.' **** 'powerful'

---"you'll also hear people say well android multi tasks and it's also a linux platform...the only thing linux about android is the kernel and android is not an open platform, whereas maemo is almost full linux but in the mobile version and you have full access to all coding within maemo and customization as much as you want unlike google or apple who go after people who customize the os.mms as well as full portrait mode control ( portrait is already available but you have to do a little trick with opening and closing programs while you have the phone in portrait ) is coming in the dec update." **** 'available'

---"i could only use it answer call, the smart keys on the headset didnt open up the contact app.basic contact management is missing - i cant select a phone number from email and add it as a contact ( something that device's of much lower caliber has managed to achieve ).copy paste doesnt work always - and there no easy way to select anything from a web page.contextual menus could have been made more usable.gmail integration works for me - but its just the mail.keyboard is a little to small - try doing ctrl+a, ctrl+c, ctrl+v frequentlysingle hand operation is almost impossible - making a phone call holding a cup of coffee and walking to work is just not happening.the device holds potential but unless there is big software update, this device is only for the gadget junkies." **** 'answer'

Positive Reviews:

---'as result, this phone can be properly used only on its widescreen orientation, which is great for texting and instant messaging, but it sucks hard when you\' ve got to look for a contact and call him.my final consideration is that this phone is worth buying if you\'re not an "intensive caller", because after a while it\' ll drive you a bit mad with its horizontal configuration(the only moment in which the interface is vertical is when you close it right before the phone call).it doesn\' t have only cons though: the interface is original and very nice to see and use, you just have to take some time to get used to it.the keyboard is probably my favourite part, it\' s freaking comfortable, way better than on-screen ones, it made me almost forget i was not using a laptop to chat.the other nice thing is the operating system: you\' ve got a full-featured linux distribution running on it, therefore you\'ve got access to some of the most well-known software: firefox, xchat, pidgin and so on; the default browser is by far the best one i\'ve ever tried on a mobile device(also thanks to the keyboard).an impression i had is that sometimes the whole system suffers a bit because of the cpu speed, which should be ~600mhz, but it\'s acceptable, the only thing is that it\'s not as fluid as an iphone.to sum up everything, i think this is a good phone for a geek(also because of nice qt development environment), but i wouldn\'t recommend it to the average user.' **** 'average'

---"in all of this connectivity awesomeness, the one flaw is that nokia has a proprietary usb port, so if you lose your charger or the usb cable, you have to buy one that fits a nokia n900 (and an assorted few other nokia devices) there are third party manufacturers, but its just one more connector shape you have to be aware of.i will say that battery life can be an issue, expecially if you plan on having 3g connectivity and do a lot of browsing then buying a second battery is practically required.since the n900 hasn't turned into a smashing success for nokia, the community of users is fairly small." **** 'second'
---"but only for conversations and sms, this phone battery can easily last 2 days.compared to n810, this model is much more improved, faster and is compatible with gsm.what i dont like is that i can't see my online skype friends unless they dont call me or send im.thank you and, i realy recomend to buy n900 if you like to have the jet-fighter of the modern phones." **** 'last'

---"this is one of the main thing's critics use to dissuade potential n900 buyers.yes it has a resistive touchscreen but you don't notice it, the responsiveness of the screen is comparable to that of the iphone of any android touch screen capacitive device ( yes i had an iphone so i know the screen )." **** 'main'

---'the n900 is a recourse for those who want genuine freedom from their smartphones, and who don\'t mind the phone giving that freedom willingly instead of requiring you to break into it.naturally, then, when you receive an n900, the first thing you should do is use the desktop menu\'s "add shortcut" command to add a shortcut to x terminal to the desktop, since it is the most important application on the n900.' **** 'first'
---"if you can restrain yourself from downloading and installing the entire debian library of apps, and can live with only running perhaps a few dozen programs at most, the n900 should serve you perfectly well, but anyone who just wanted to firehose the entire operating system into their smartphone will need to wait for nokia to release a phone with a multi-gigabyte rootfs.there's one other thing which i should probably touch on in this review: you may be wondering, how well does the n900 serve as a voice device?" **** 'other'
---"i know it's not just about this phone, but still it's annoying being unable to use 3g internet for more than 1 hour because then you run out of charge for the whole day.second thing, some choices in the design of the case are disputable, the screen's on/off switch is on the bottom of the phone implying the use of two hands to activate/deactivate it, which is quite annoying." **** 'whole'
---'as result, this phone can be properly used only on its widescreen orientation, which is great for texting and instant messaging, but it sucks hard when you\' ve got to look for a contact and call him.my final consideration is that this phone is worth buying if you\'re not an "intensive caller", because after a while it\' ll drive you a bit mad with its horizontal configuration(the only moment in which the interface is vertical is when you close it right before the phone call).it doesn\' t have only cons though: the interface is original and very nice to see and use, you just have to take some time to get used to it.the keyboard is probably my favourite part, it\' s freaking comfortable, way better than on-screen ones, it made me almost forget i was not using a laptop to chat.the other nice thing is the operating system: you\' ve got a full-featured linux distribution running on it, therefore you\'ve got access to some of the most well-known software: firefox, xchat, pidgin and so on; the default browser is by far the best one i\'ve ever tried on a mobile device(also thanks to the keyboard).an impression i had is that sometimes the whole system suffers a bit because of the cpu speed, which should be ~600mhz, but it\'s acceptable, the only thing is that it\'s not as fluid as an iphone.to sum up everything, i think this is a good phone for a geek(also because of nice qt development environment), but i wouldn\'t recommend it to the average user.' **** 'acceptable'

Negative Reviews:

---'n900 has greater potential.' **** 'potential'
---"if you've used one of those devices, you already know how great they are, so consider the n900 basically a similar device with gsm connectivity to boot, meaning you can take the already-mature maemo interface almost anywhere in the world and get online with it.before we go into details, let's go ahead and get a couple of things out of the way which aren't important, but which have been mentioned by some others: contacts and calendaring." **** 'consider'

---"(can't beat the almighty n82's xenon flash).music playback is really good.speakers are loud and clear and you can also use any headphones you want to really enjoy your mp3's.video playback is excellent both on the phone's screen and also while using tv-out.this thing plays the most common video formats without the need to convert.you just drag and drop your videos from you pc and enjoy them.what really impressed me was the transfer speed for files when connected via mass storage.it's really fast.this is why i like nokia - no i-tunes here.only freedom.the hardware keyboard is really good and i got pretty big fingers.the touchscreen keyboard is great also.the phone has a solid build and it has a very sexy design i might say.not really thin but it's so powerful you won't think about size.the gps i don't use as i have a standalone unit but it's good to know it's there.from what i understand the n900 will be able to run the meego os when it comes out so i'd say it's also future-proof.one of the few things that i don't like about it is that at the moment it doesn't have portrait mode (except for photo gallery,the phone app and the browser)it will be added in the near future hopefully.also it doesn't have mms natively.you have to install an app to send and receive mms.personally don't use mms but i just want to know it's there.at the moment the apps for the n900 are few but even so (for me at least) this device already does everything i expected from it.such is it's power.overall i love this minilaptop as i like to call it.if you want power and freedom the n900 is for you." **** 'able'

---"i'm pretty sure this is how nokia describes this phone and its pretty accurate." **** 'sure'
---"here's the results so far:verdict: n900 is one year old, which is forever in smartphone years, and i don't really care for the iphone that much now that i have this.details:- n900 is customizable like crazy, iphone isn't even near; the four desktops are a thing of beauty and make my little heart sing (n900 wins hands down)- the screen on the nokia is beautiful, but on the iphone it's like you're holding the screen, not a bulky device behind it - impressive; (tie)- the iphone4 is heavier, lol (or about the same, i didn't check; twice as thin but doesn't feel lighter, which is a surprise)- ovi maps sucks; i wanted to find a doctor's office nearby, and the iphone4 does this in a few taps, and also lets you call the office; i have yet to find a way/app to do this on the nokia; currently testing out a few apps for navigation, so far no dice; would appreciate some help from you folks who already did this (iphone wins)- the sheer number of apps, if someone wants them all, but i don't really care [see?" **** 'beautiful'
---"yes, getting applications on the n900 that aren't blessed by nokia is relatively easy." **** 'easy'
---'this makes me very hopeful for future nokia phones also.' **** 'future'
---'i wont lie...if and when that htc hd2 comes out...i will probably jump ship and i know its windows...but i navigate windows just fine...for me...ok tired...later guys...to anyone who reads this...if you love nokia....you gotta get this...if you have a certain nostalgia for that classic nokia ring...go for it...if your new blood...you may not be so dazzled...so go get the nexus then...its really form factor...cause the hardware on this blowsssssssss away anything else...camera, build quality, sound quality, etc.' **** 'classic'
---'the firmware and software is still in the early stages but i am sure nokia is working this out very soon, especially the turn-by-turn navigation.' **** 'sure'
---"i went to fry's electronics couple days ago and the phone guy shared that they had 15 on stock and it was gone in a week.i do wish nokia the best in producing a phone that works and specs sounded great for this phone but the reality is that it is not ready yet." **** 'best'
---"a trip to the forums shows all sorts of entries of things people don't like or would like better and nokia is actually implementing many of the suggestions." **** 'better'
---"helps at some point but it's better if nokia supports it too like they do on symbian)* definitely needs a firmware upgrade to support some if not all programs in portrait mode* camera is so-so* a 3g device with a front camera but can't do video call as of now (i know t-mo doesn't have the video call service but european and asian networks that uses the 2100mhz 3g are supported as well as the video call service)* the device stand is really thin and flimsy." **** 'better'
---"and on the manual, the nokia folks certainly took to heart the minimalist mantra that's circulating among documentation professionals -- if the manual were any more minimal, it would be invisible." **** 'manual'
---"to be honest, i think nokia did better job at making touch screen.overall: you should buy it considering it's less than $600 and unlocked!argument:some people may think if the product available in us does not neccessary have to include chinese input." **** 'honest'
---'however i would really like to meet the design head or whoever was heading the design aspect of this phone and several other nokia phones.' **** 'other'
