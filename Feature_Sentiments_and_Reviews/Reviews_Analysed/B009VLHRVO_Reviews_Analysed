---'pros: nice screen when it works, big screen, performance, gobs of memory plus(at&t;) microsd expansion (a must-have for convenience transferring music andpictures to a new phone or your pc)-cons: battery life, non-replaceable battery, poor sound, no keyboard or opticalmouse, clumsy interface, no stock flashlight app, overheating issues, non-standard charger profile--  had this phone 2 weeks and hating it.' **** 'nice'
---'is a great phone ... but be careful of the screen ... will shatter for no reason.... it was laying on my desk went to pick it up and the screen was shattered.... is gonna take 2 weeks to get it fixed because the screens r on back order... and the repair cost is $185.00  and the deductible for insurance is $199.00... and the trade in value is only $26.70... other than that i would give this phone a 5 star rating..' **** 'careful'

---"i liked the big screen (still bigger than the iphone) and the microsd slot of the infuse; i did not like the slow pace of os updates from samsung, and the cheap-feeling back cover.i had been looking at the samsung galaxy s iii and the htc one x+ before reading about the optimus g (and it's brother, the nexus 4)." **** 'bigger'
---'i am so impressed with the clear display.good touch, beautiful screen, great user interface, memory upgrade is possible with memory slot in att version.but the quality of 8m camera in att version is not good enough comparing 13m camera in sprint version.overall this phone is the most amazing phone i have ever seen and used until now.' **** 'beautiful'

---"i find theinterface much more clumsy than my previous htc which allowed you to turn theflash on and off from the screen without using menus.-  the htc flashlight app which came with my old phone was much simpler anduseful than all the other apps i have found on gplay.-  i don't know if its an at&t; mod or just android 4.0, but when looking atpictures it doesn't seem to bring up your latest pic, you have to scroll to lookfor it." **** 'other'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"the battery will have to be recharged every 12-24 hours *at least* so sometimes twice per day, and that means that the battery will not last 2 years and will have to be replaced (lg claims that their poly-ion batt will do 800 cycles, so maybe it will last two years; although considering that it eats juice at least as bad as any other smartphone, you'll probably be recharging it more like 5xs every 4 days at best or more likely 3xs/2days, so then again, maybe that battery won't hold up for the length of the contract)." **** 'likely'

---"secondly, the phone has an unfortunate tendency to overheat out of the box(interestingly, i haven't seen this over the last few days, so perhaps it goes away with use)." **** 'last'
---"at the end of the last few days i've been putting it on the charger before bed with 25% or more left, and when it's not so new and i'm not constantly tinkering with it i can see that number going up to 35-40% at the end of every day.cons-glass everywhere." **** 'last'
