---'Camera is decent in good lighting, but grainy in average lighting.' **** 'decent'

Negative Reviews:

---"Let's start with the good, the screen is much better than I expected very clear and colors pop it's no htc one or samsung galaxy s5 but its a very decent screen very good for the price, its a very responsive phone apps run good very little lag, the speaker is good its loud and no issues with it, I have t-mobile and the speeds are decent above average pretty fast, it has about 1gb of memory for apps and about 2 gb for pictures, music and documents but the good thing is that it will allow you to move the apps to sd card at least most of them like games, the camera is decent not the fastest shutter speed but not the slowest camera either, I had a nexus 4 and it does take better pictures, but the nexus 4 isn't known for having a good camera, youtube, netflix run flawless even with the 3g speeds hardly ever renders the videos, and games run pretty good I've installed intense graphic games like asphalt 8, modern combat 3 and 4 and was impressed that it handled them pretty well." **** 'good'
