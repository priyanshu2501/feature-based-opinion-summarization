---"the battery even though it's only 2000mah it lasts a long time i also have an htc one m7 and the battery on this blu studio last longer must be because of the lower resolution of the display but the battery last alot longer than my htc one, bluetooth connection is good also no issues or problems with that.now for the bad l the screen at time gets unresponsive have to press very hard so it will register the action i want sometimes it happens while unlocking the screen i don't know if its only my device and i have a defective one but too much issue to send it back and find out, keyboard is bad i installed the google keyboard trying to see if that would do any better and it is better than the stock but every know in then for some reason the screen won't register the letter i'm pressing and won't type the letter for some reason the screen gets unresponsive while typing don't know if it has to do also with the prior issue it might be part of that same problem doesn't happen every time but now and then i have gotten that problem, now the earphones you can only use the earphone's that come with the device they sound good but not great, i have some skullcandy earphones that sound awesome with my htc one and for some reason with this phone the music sounds lousy you can barely hear the person sing so there is an issue with that and i have tried two more earphones and also headphones and same issue only the earphone's that come with device seem to work properly like i stated before, and know for the the thing that bothers me the most and that i have the most issue with is that the gps is very bad, sometimes can't lock on to a satellite and it will say searching for satellite and if your lucky it might lock on and you'll get the route for a while then once you reach a different area where the signal isn't that good it will stop and not work and sometimes try to re-route you because the satellite can't properly get your location and one time it couldn't even look up the address i needed, and luckily i had my other phone and put the same sim i was using on this device on to the other and it found the address with no problem so there is a lot of issues with the gps so if you depend on gps don't get this phone unless for some reason my device is defective if it weren't for that main issue i would probably give 4 stars, hope this review is helpful." **** 'last'
