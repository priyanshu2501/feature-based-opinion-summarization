__________('call', 'volume')__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"i've definitely missed calls b/c the volume was too soft, and it was very difficult to hear the other end of the conversation when i did receive a call in public.- not many accessories came with the phone, so you'll have to buy your own case, usb cord, memory card, etc, and they're all pretty expensive." **** 'receive'
---'now its broken, and nobody will repair it.the camera takes the best photos i have seen from a phone, but the phone features are average at best:1. call volume and ringer volume is low, even at the highest setting2.' **** 'low'


================================================================================================================
__________('software',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'for example, there was a very limited number of ring tones that were part of the software, and they werent even that good.' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---'i got the software for free from the samsung website.' **** 'free'
---'you just have to make sure to not rest your hand on the antenna panel on the top back of the handset as to not hinder the performance of the antenna.as of yet, i have not had the chance to use the microsd slot and download mp3s onto the phone, so i will not be able to comment on that.overall, this is a well functioning phone that is very well constructed with easy to use software.' **** 'easy'

__________('thing',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the only good thing is the cool micro sd card slot but to convert files to watch it on yr cell is the biggest pain, even worst the pic window is really small and the voice quality sucks so watchin yr fav show on yr cell while travelin is a good idea but bad with this phone.' **** 'good'
---'ok the phone is cool and i like doing the slide thing as much as the next guy or gal.' **** 'much'

__________('speaker',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"i wish the volume could be turned up higher on the speaker phone, but i usually use a bluetooth headset, so for most of my calls it doesn't matter." **** 'higher'

Negative Reviews:

---'first, you push the speaker phone button then, it is going to ask you if you want the speaker phone on or off.the phone is not user friendly!' **** 'first'
---'it could use a another speaker or just a bigger one.' **** 'bigger'
---'good speaker phone, good gui, too many features, inbuilt mp3 player and all this for free!the only con i found was that there is an area on the back side of the phone which seems to have the antenna - atleast the note says that the area should not be obstructed during the call.' **** 'good'
---'it quickly caught the attention of anyone happening to see it.-very large display.the bad:-very low speaker volume made it difficult to hear conversations.' **** 'low'
---'the combiation of poor reception and low speaker volume is a lethal combination that killed all of my interest in a very interesting looking, but fairly useless cell phone.' **** 'low'


================================================================================================================
__________('songs',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"in a noisy area i use the speaker phone, put it to my ear to hear it.when you slide up, sometimes (very often) the display light doesn't turn off, just dims out which causes the battery die quicker.so many things to say; mp3 player useless, navigation useless, functions useless, you can't use certain songs for ring tones, etc..i can tell you at least one excuse for each feature you have in mind." **** 'certain'

Negative Reviews:

---'i got this phone in 2006 as a christmas gift...and for the past year i havent wanted a new phone....this phone is everything i could want...and with the data cable that i bought on amazon im able to make my own ringtones from my favorite songs on my laptop and transfer them onto my phone for personalized ringtones....the bluetooth on this phone is faster than any razr or slvr ive come in contact with, and the great thing about slider phones is that its a perfect comprimise for people who want the screen size of a flip phone but hate flip phones and want a candybar phone with a bigger screen...plus...everyone compliments the phone when i pull it out and slide it up...between the phone, the 1gb memory card, and the data cable...you can do just about anything with this phone' **** 'favorite'

__________('picture',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'it even makes calls ;-)  the camera takes a very nice picture and video, and the large display shows it very clearly.' **** 'nice'
---'an old 1.3mp digital camera, with the same resolution as a new phone will still give a better picture because of the optics.' **** 'better'

Negative Reviews:

---"anyways, the samsung d807 is a nice alternative to the razr or the slvr from cingular.. i had this phone for 7 hours now and i was mostly impressed by the camera and voice dialing system.. 1.3mp is all you really need for a clear picture and a video recording function is one useful function.. but for some reason, i cant access media mall and hopefully i dont have to sign up for an online access plan.. it sucks because i can't download the ringtones i bought from the website without mediamall so i'm stuck with the default ringtones which arent too exciting.. plus the design is a bit nicer than samsung t809 in my opinion.. i think you can buy a micro sd card and store more mp3's and use it as a mp3 player but i'm not sure about that.. theres always ipod for music..anyways if you need to do more than just call people on the phone, d807 is the perfect choice.." **** 'clear'
---"90% of my friends have razrs so i don't have much competition, but i really do have the best picture quality out of all of them." **** 'best'

Positive Reviews:

---'nice phone with good video and picture capture capabilities.' **** 'good'
---"i also recorded a small video but dont know how to play it on my computer yet.micro sd card option is great for transfering pics and video's.shortcut buttons are the best, once you customize it to your use, you will never have to go thru those menu's again.blue tooth is another plus, i use it to transfer pics to my pc, i share my phone book entries and pics with my wife.voice dial is good, considering you dont have to train the phone first, which was the case in earlier samsung phones." **** 'small'

---"it doesn't have as many features as nokia 6682 or sony w900 but the design is much more practical and comfortable.pros: big fonts, sliding panel, number indexed menu items.cons: cannot play mp3 with stereo bluetooth headsets (no a2dp).switching to silence and vibration mode is not quiet because it is controlled by the volume button which will sing when you press it." **** 'much'
---'other than that, its useless.slide design: 3 stars.' **** 'other'


================================================================================================================
__________('easy', 'to', 'use')__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"and too much of a high price.1) the calls are hard to listen to unless you're in a very quiet place, the volume output is very low (and no, i'm not earing impaired).2) because of #1, you can forget about making good use of the speaker phone (unless, like me, you are in  a crowded pace and you want to stick the speaker to your ear to be abe to undestand.3) the navigation among applications and function is not easy." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"not sure about 2 gig, but i'm using a 1 gig card and it works fine.2) inexpensive adapters that let you use any headphones with this unit are readily available if you look around (try google).3) sound quality is quite good, but this phone does have some limitations as a music player, mostly because of the design of the player software itself, notably:a) you can organize songs into folders on the sd card, but the player will not let you add songs in folders to a playlist.b) the length of a playlist is limited.c) the player will only play mp3s at 192kbps or less, and the filename can be no greater than 28 characters (why, i have absolutely no idea)." **** 'good'
---'i have used the mp3 capability and it does work fairly well sound quality is not the best but it plays well compared to similarly priced phones.' **** 'best'
