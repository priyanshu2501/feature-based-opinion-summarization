Positive Reviews:

---"although i've never replaced a cell phone batter, i can see the potential issues with this phone having a non-removable battery (the iphone's been doin' it since day 1) battery life is average for a smartphone, but with proper controls it could probably last 2 days on light use.call quality is typicalthis phone is a great buy and i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a well-featured phone at a reasonable price." **** 'light'

__________('calls',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i have experienced very few dropped calls as this service/phone allows me to talk in areas that the iphone did not.' **** 'dropped'
---'the service is well worth the 35 dollars a month and texts and phone calls always come thru clear and accurate.' **** 'clear'
---'the service is well worth the 35 dollars a month and texts and phone calls always come thru clear and accurate.' **** 'accurate'
---"beats audio is a bit of a gimmick, and in my opinion isn't anything but a pre-amp with added bass, but it does improve the sound quality while on vs while off.call quality is fine and i have never had issues with any dropped calls in my service area.the battery life is good compared to similar android smartphones, but it's lack of a user replaceable battery will encourage you to buy a car charger or be close to an available usb port if you will be away from ac power for more than a day at a time." **** 'dropped'
---'), and it has an ugly arch at the bottom of the phone, why ?maybe to make calls sound better when you talk.' **** 'better'
---'the calls are clear and crisp, too!' **** 'clear'

Negative Reviews:

---"nice for storing video, photos and large attachment files from emails.free apps you might enjoy:  scanner radio, zedge (wallpapers and ringtones for free...), pinterest, amazon price check, gemini app manager, app2sd (send apps to your storage card versus leaving on internal memory...), and cozi family organizer.don't hesitate to get this one if you want to enjoy facebook, youtube videos, taking great photos and video, gps navigation, and enjoying your music, as well as making and receiving clear calls on the virgin mobile (sprint) network.update: 9/11/12the camera on this thing rocks!" **** 'clear'
---'there are no feature to make younumber private, all calls are public and no settingsto configure private calling.' **** 'public'
---"ditto for missed calls--it's not uncommon for me to have a voicemail for a call that didn't show up as having been missed, nevermind the fact that i had the phone the whole time and it never rang.sometimes it can't find the wifi network, even when my other devices aren't having that problem.the htc one phone seems cheaply made." **** 'uncommon'
---'lots of dropped calls too.' **** 'dropped'
---'calls are clear if you have a good vm signal (their problem not htc), and runs apps a good clip.' **** 'clear'
