__________('something',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'overall, if there is something you want to do repeatedly online, there is likely an android application to help you do it easily.my biggest caution with apps on android is that while google is not annoying us by limiting users from accessing, buying or installing applications on our phones like apple does with the iphone app store, android phone users are also more susceptible to installing applications that can waste battery life or phone memory because they are programmed poorly (does anyone really need a fart application?!)' **** 'overall'
---'its running android 2.2 out of the box i have no clue when samsung will get the update and i didnt wanna wait or modify my phone with something unofficial.' **** 'unofficial'
---'i think it is hard for iphone users to believe that something this good is available.' **** 'good'
---'i think it is hard for iphone users to believe that something this good is available.' **** 'available'
---"htc did something awfully wrong with these speakers and i have no idea what it is, but it's extremely annoyingthat's about it, other than that i can tell you ill eventually root the phone and that may be the only way to bypass some of the safeguards built into the phone that are so irritating, and for no apparent good reason." **** 'wrong'
---'i was attached to my blackberry before this, but was always looking for something better.' **** 'better'
---'everyday i find something new to love about my evo.' **** 'new'
---'i have always had pre-paid phones so i knew that if i am going to get a contract phone for 2 years, it has to be something that is reliable and has a lot of features.i did a lot of research on this phone and a few others on youtube and other review websites as well and i looked at different cell companies and decided to go with sprint since they had the 69.99 everything data plan.' **** 'reliable'

Negative Reviews:

---'for every sparkly new technology step forward there\'s always something dauntingly complex or "glichy" that makes me think why bother keeping up with the latest buzz toy?' **** 'complex'
---'overall, it would be hard to find something that works great.' **** 'overall'
---"and there have been times where an application has frozen on me, but that's not happened often at all.i can only say this, if you're a tech junkie who loves tinkering with technology, and loves something that can become much more than just an ordinary cell phone, i whole-heartedly recommend this phone to you." **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---"you have to pay extra for 4g -- whether your area gets it or not -- and i haven't really noticed an increase in speed anyway." **** 'extra'
---'3g speeds in this area are above average, typically over 2 mbps downloads and 750 kbps uploads.' **** 'average'
---'only drawback (probably not unique to sprint) is slow speed on 3g, but more than fast enough on wi-fi, or if you are lucky enough to live in a 4g area.' **** 'enough'
---'you could possibly drain the battery completely in a couple of hours if you were: in a bad 4g area, trying wi-fi also at the same time, and using gps all at the same time.' **** 'bad'
---'if on a typical day i use it as a phone, on standby, and turn 4g on for a few minutes at a time when checking email or using navigation, and then back to standby, then in the evening the phone will have about 40% of the battery charge left, which is not bad at all.- 4g is great, when it works or if it available in your area.' **** 'available'
---"i don't live in a 4g area so i have no need for enabling the antenna, but if you do live in a 4g covered area... the easiest workaround would be to carry your charger (evo comes with a wall+usb charger) or to use 4g only when you absolutely need it like uploading an 8 megapixel photo to flickr." **** 'live'

---'if i have to zoom in the text on the page "word wraps" the text so i can still read it without scrolling left--->right.the screen is awesome....nice colors, great resolution...awesome.the speed is great.the keyboard is bigger....but the really kicker is the swype program which quickly made me forget about how much i loved my work blackberry keyboard (but hated everything but email)i had concerns about moving to sprint as i had them about 5 years ago and hated their customer service and service.....they have obviously changed somethings.' **** 'bigger'

---"this multi-function micro-mainframe of an instrument has multiple draws on its battery:  gps, wifi, and, you can actually talk on the thing.so here's my bottom line:  if they could give me an easier keyboard, or allow full voice recognition (i use and love dragon 10.1 at work), evo and i would become soul mates." **** 'easier'

---"for the following reasons:- personally, i prefer a slider keyboard... though now i'm thinking, with the right phone, i could probably live without it.- i'm motivated to remain with sprint because the network performs at least as well as verizon here in l.a. at 75% of the price (though vz still has the best customer service)- sprint gave me a free airave (signal booster) without a monthly fee by just asking." **** 'best'

---'(also free sprint tv, radio, navigation, all integrates with google services, so much more, oh andthe phone works great too!)' **** 'free'
---"sprint will blame it on amazon until they find out you have two phone lines in the house, call amazon tech support and amazon confirms--several times over a speaker phone so the sprint supervisor can hear--that they are not placing any hidden charges, and you are only being charged (by amazon) $199.99 for the phone to ship.after about an hour you will hear (and make sure to have at least one hour of free time to hear this come out of the new sprint sales supervisor's mouth) that there was an error when processing the credit check/loan/whatever you want to call it and that you have been, basically, charged twice.you are left with 2 options: cancel the original plan, or pay sprint another $100." **** 'new'
---'when i switch on the faster 4g speeds (for which i\'m charged an extra $10 per month) the gtalk connection times out with an error.i phoned sprint technical support and was passed along to "advanced support" who quite incredibly (and wrongly) explained that the reason that the gtalk connection was not working was that it wasn\'t compatible with sprint\'s 4g service (totally wrong).use caution with sprint - i\'m still evaluating but so far the evo 4g hardware is holding up ok (as soon as i figure out the gtalk connection issue).' **** 'technical'
---"the helpful sprint support staff ran the gamut of telling me that gtalk was incompatible with 4g and that the 4g service which was clocking 8 to 10 mb downloads on my evo wasn't in fact active in my town.i completely wiped the device (twice) and tried another google account." **** 'helpful'
---"even a good thick skin would be be great as well as backup.it was down to a iphone or a evo,but sprint won because of a cheaper monthly plan that suited my needs.i'm not knocking the iphone as i know thats a great phone as well,but i'm very happy with the sprint evo." **** 'happy'
---"i guess she didn't want to deal with an issue that cannot be helped.so in conclusion, my impressions about the evo phone are great, but sprint technical support and ability to do simple stuff such as send a text message, leave a lot to be desired.update (mar.11/2011)by now i have a better idea about the phone (and service that comes with it)." **** 'technical'

---'i own three phones, sprint palm pre, t-mobile nexus one, and this htc evo 4g.one thing i have noticed over the physical keyboard and the nexus one multi-touch is that htc evo 4g simply has the biggest screen size that allows for easy of typing and it\'s touchscreen!for business people (like me), it\'s important that i can type fast and the htc evo lets me do that easily because the keyboard "never" misses, i can type faster than my palm pre, which has a physical keyboard.other than that, the large 4.3" screen isn\'t large enough to make it a burden on your pocket while its perfect size for typing on the go.this is the best smartphone ever due to its "design" not the 4g or that it has a kickstand.if you have been stuck with a blackberry because of a keyboard, this is the right time to switch, to a real smartphone that can do everything.gotta love it!p.s.' **** 'biggest'

---"i bought the platinum case with holster - i'll review it separately, but suffice to say that i am happy with it.there are an unlimited number of practical apps for the phone, and with google behind the android operating system, there is no doubt that this will be the platform of choice for developers in the future.i ordered the phone from amazon and it arrived several days in advance of the promised date.while not listed on sprint's website, apparently nashville has some limited 4g." **** 'practical'
---'in return for the apps, be aware that you surrender significant personal information on your phone, your location (at minumum the nearest cell tower, and in some cases your gps-derived location) and details of how you used the phone and applications.' **** 'aware'
---'also if you are in family plan it will be even better for others to have the unlimited data at low cost.my most used apps are mail, messenger, calendar, qik, camera, contact book, skype, etc.only drawback is battery life.. which these days we have chargers every where.. at home, car and office... so if you notice most of the smart phones are charging when not in use.' **** 'used'
---"given the 30 days return policy decided to give a try evo, i brought this phone understanding the battery limitation while getting the phone and i have no regrets so far(3 weeks into it).here are few things to help u decide if you are not sure about evo yet.pros- best phone h/w(except battery) available in us market today.- 4g coverage and including teetering with sprint makes this deal even more sweeter.- android o/s give you a lot of flexibility i.e how your phone looks, how is behaves or what app you could run etc etc, you might want this or not depending your technical background(iphone still wins on ease of use).- very good camera(don't expect it to replace ur canon or sony but still good enough for casual shots).- better value for money with sprint when compare with at&t; or verizon($79 - unlimited data, unlimited msg, 450 anytime mins, unlimited any mobile to any mobile(not just sprint) calling).- very fast, i didn't realize how slow iphone 3g was until i used evo.- flash works.- all the main apps i used on iphone i found them on andriod market so far." **** 'main'
---'most of the popular apps from iphone are available on android though, so that has not been an issue so far.' **** 'popular'
---"i can't tell you the best apps to get as it depends on how you're using the phone." **** 'best'
---"i fell asleep while looking through all the apps this phone has, and like a buddy of mine said, most of the apps are free, free, and did i say free apps.well that's all i have to comment about this phone on here." **** 'free'

---'email client can easily be replaced with other apps if you wish though.touch screen is very sensitive and fast.' **** 'other'
---'we had looked into buying a mifi, but that only supports 4 wireless connections and the evo supports 8.+ great screen; the large screen has an amazingly clear picture and the touch sensitivity is just about perfect for me+ intuitive interface; i had this mastered after five minutes or so if navigating around+ lots of apps; there are a huge number of useful apps available, including the free kindle reader+ two cameras; this has an 8mp primary camera on the back and a 1mp secondary camera facing the user, very cool!+ hd video; a very usable 720p video camera (i used it to shoot a video review on another product and it turned out fairly well)+ hdmi out; has a mini hdmi connector for connecting it to a hd tv.' **** 'available'
---'apps load in less than a second and the pre installed apps almost always load up instantly.8 megapixel camera: the camera is great.' **** 'less'
---'if you do not want to root, then there are paid tethering apps available in the market.' **** 'available'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'coming from a nokia xpressmusic 5800 that was also capable of full-gps and 3g web browsing, but could still last 2 days with very heavy use and a week(!)' **** 'last'
---"reviews stated that with the extended battery's full peak performance, the life of its.charge has been known to last for days." **** 'last'
---'in my early days of experimentation, i went from 100% charge when i went to bed to 15% by morning.' **** 'early'
---'just got this phone a few days ago and am pretty happy so far.' **** 'happy'
---'the first few days when you are going to be playing with the phone the most, it will die a few times a day.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'the first few days i had the evo i did not have a screen protector yet.' **** 'first'
---'(8-10 apps).- better micrsoft exchange integration for emails/calender then iphone 3g.cons- sprint charges extra $10 for evo.- short battery life, for me battery last 1 full days(7am-8pm) with personal email, work email, bluetooth, 3g, light web surfing.- cdma not gsm and not portable to any other career.' **** 'last'
---'compared to my old palm pilot, it takes about 20 times more clicks and many more minutes of frustrtation just to enter a simple contact.so if anyone has any suggestions for an alternative ui or contact/calendar/notes app, i would appreciate it.oh, one more thing: i find that "speak" (speach recognition) option is less and less available - their server is always busy when i need it... so i have learned to not even waste my time on trying to use it any more.and yet another thing: i bought this because there was a promise of 4g and skype in the early days of htc evo.' **** 'early'
---'i gave this htc evo a heck of a chance for the past 30 days.' **** 'past'
---"at first, i couldn't get it last past 3pm, but found how to optimize the settings and can now make it last about 2 days on one charge(it just really depends on how much you use 4g)i'll add to this review over time, but overall i think the evo is a great iphone replacement for those that like to fiddle with and customize their phone." **** 'last'
