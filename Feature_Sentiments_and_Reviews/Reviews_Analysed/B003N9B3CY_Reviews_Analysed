Positive Reviews:

---'When in a strong 4g area the speeds are unbelievable.' **** 'strong'
---"I might not be that upset about it if we had 4g in my area but we don't... 2 - $30 for wifi hotspot option." **** 'upset'
---'4G when available is slower then 3g in the same area, lack of video over 4g which was mentioned as an advantage over iPhone, and terrible interface design all contribute to this update.' **** 'available'

Negative Reviews:

---"You have to pay extra for 4G -- whether your area gets it or not -- and I haven't really noticed an increase in speed anyway." **** 'extra'
---'Only drawback (probably not unique to sprint) is slow speed on 3G, but more than fast enough on wi-fi, or if you are lucky enough to live in a 4G area.' **** 'enough'
---'As for 4G, it is not available in my area.' **** 'available'
---'If you are in a weak 4g area, then battery will be drained much faster.' **** 'weak'
---'You could possibly drain the battery completely in a couple of hours if you were: in a bad 4g area, trying wi-fi also at the same time, and using gps all at the same time.' **** 'bad'
---'If on a typical day I use it as a phone, on standby, and turn 4g on for a few minutes at a time when checking email or using navigation, and then back to standby, then in the evening the phone will have about 40% of the battery charge left, which is not bad at all.- 4g is great, when it works or if it available in your area.' **** 'available'
---"I don't live in a 4G area so I have no need for enabling the antenna, but if you do live in a 4G covered area... the easiest workaround would be to carry your charger (EVO comes with a wall+usb charger) or to use 4G only when you absolutely need it like uploading an 8 megapixel photo to Flickr." **** 'live'

Negative Reviews:

---'Unfortunately, two things prevent this even if you live in a place where 4G actually exists: 1) Sprint charges a $30 a month super-premium for wifi tethering on top of the charge for data (yes, Sprint expects a yearly, $480 Christmas Present) and, 2) using 4G alone, on battery power will turn that, sleek fully-charged smartphone of yours into a paperweight in less than an hour no matter what background processes you turn off.' **** 'yearly'
