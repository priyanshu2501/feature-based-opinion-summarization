---'the only real worries i had when purchasing this; was since i am not activating this on my verizon account with service -- how i would install applications etc., and also how well it would play music... #1) after reading online; i discovered the way manually to download, transfer onto device, and install @ (.apk/.exe) runtime files via a program called @ "astro file" also others as "android file manager", "es file manager", etc., all work good also... so i don\'t need @ internet service and google play app store directly -- which is nice and comforting, albeit more work than clicking a simple install link to the file... #2) i was worried about how well these smartphones in general., and especially this android x in question., would not only just play my music -- but be able to properly @ chronologically and-or alphabetically arrange my files in my personalized folders without ruining the artist-song titles and throwing everything shuffled out of alphabetical order all over the place throughout the folders... when i got this phone and put in my 32gb micro-sd card loaded music, and went to search for and play my music with the motorola droid x\'s built-in @ music player app -- my worst fears were confirmed as this phone\'s system would not recognize the song-track artist and title and alphabetical-listing properly as i loaded everything onto the player., albeit would recognize my personalized folders., and completely destroyed/edited my @ song\'s artist and title with gibberish and randomly scatter my songs out of listing throughout the folder at various points like a mangled car-wreck disaster at 120mph., and but everything would be normal upon connecting device to pc and entering windows o.s desktop again... #3) in response to #2... i went searching online for an alternative @ "music/video player app", and after searching for hours and downloading 8 different music/video-player app -- i finally came upon one program that is the best in my opinion and experience -- called @ ("folder player")., and which handles my folders with songs in artist/track-titles flawlessly as they\'re loaded from the computer as i want them in alphabetical order with needed features such as \'in player option\' of @ delete etc., and a real nice professional stylish "black and white" interface and widget-face to match the motorola android x\'s color "grey and white" scheme... since installing this ("folder player") app; i have been using this motorola android x constantly for hours every day and am in heaven and cannot seem to put it down, lol... i need my music -- it is my life and soul and existence and sanity :)... the phone itself, plays my music superbly without any play-errors or audio-distortions... with @ ("folder player") installed, this has become an excellent alternative to standalone traditional multimedia mp3 players and even digital camcorders and cameras -- and far superior to any traditional @ mp3 player on the market with mass so much extra options to use and in quality also especially... i am very satisfied with this product and my order and highly recommend to others to get one -- if not as an activated serviced @ smartphone, than as an standalone @ "smart multimedia music/video/picture player" by itself alone as an alternative to standard usual \'same-o, same-o\' mp3 players., use the programs like @ "es file manager" etc., to manually install all the apps you want onto the device!!' **** 'music'

---'{{{screen size and touchscreen type/quality/response-time}}} the @ "screen size" is 4.3 inches -- which is a breath of fresh air, sort of speak, when coming from traditional mobile multimedia @ "mp3 players" which only have a general usual tiny screen-size of @ "1.6 inches to 3.2 inches" and need a magnifying-glass to view everything... with the 4.3 inch screen, i am able to enjoy and view all my photos, music, and videos perfectly clearly with every detail in focus -- note to mention: also able to operate the features/options of the phone with ease versus small touchscreens of traditional mp3 players... the @ "touchscreen type" is @ "capacitive"., so this basically means that it operates from the static energy produced by your fingers in which you barely have to touch the screen to operate its programs/options of buttons., and responds instantly after giving a push-command to the screen vs. that of @ "resistive touchscreens" which you have have to press on the screen and press hard to operate its programs/options and usually takes a slower response-time of about 1-2 seconds generally... the @ "response time" of this phone is instant and lightning(blitzkrieg) fast -- not only equal to my @ lg spectrum 2 and my mother\'s samsung galaxy s-iii.,but far superior(faster quality) in response-times than my spectrum 2 also in a lot of areas of operation... the only problem often a nuisance, because it\'s @ "capacitive" and so sensitive: if you\'re not conscious about it, than even having simply your fingertips on the edge will randomly active the screen with command gestures for options/features/programs/buttons on the screen., and often annoying when playing music and all of a sudden it switches to another song or folder etc., without actually touching the screen and pushing anything... even if you don\'t remember to @ "dim the screen to standbye" after doing something like changing a song etc., even the slightest breeze gust of @ wind will active the screens\' features/options/programs and even simply pressing the phone up against your body etc., will do it... you really have to be conscious when using @ "capacitive touchscreens"... but the @ "lightning speed in responses times" is well worth every bit of the nuisance., reducing my stress and impatience from add/adhd from throwing the thing up against the wall etc from waiting even a second or two which seems like an eternity., lulz... another reason why i wanted to break away from traditional @ mp3 players, and try something new!' **** 'worth'

---'{{{screen size and touchscreen type/quality/response-time}}} the @ "screen size" is 4.3 inches -- which is a breath of fresh air, sort of speak, when coming from traditional mobile multimedia @ "mp3 players" which only have a general usual tiny screen-size of @ "1.6 inches to 3.2 inches" and need a magnifying-glass to view everything... with the 4.3 inch screen, i am able to enjoy and view all my photos, music, and videos perfectly clearly with every detail in focus -- note to mention: also able to operate the features/options of the phone with ease versus small touchscreens of traditional mp3 players... the @ "touchscreen type" is @ "capacitive"., so this basically means that it operates from the static energy produced by your fingers in which you barely have to touch the screen to operate its programs/options of buttons., and responds instantly after giving a push-command to the screen vs. that of @ "resistive touchscreens" which you have have to press on the screen and press hard to operate its programs/options and usually takes a slower response-time of about 1-2 seconds generally... the @ "response time" of this phone is instant and lightning(blitzkrieg) fast -- not only equal to my @ lg spectrum 2 and my mother\'s samsung galaxy s-iii.,but far superior(faster quality) in response-times than my spectrum 2 also in a lot of areas of operation... the only problem often a nuisance, because it\'s @ "capacitive" and so sensitive: if you\'re not conscious about it, than even having simply your fingertips on the edge will randomly active the screen with command gestures for options/features/programs/buttons on the screen., and often annoying when playing music and all of a sudden it switches to another song or folder etc., without actually touching the screen and pushing anything... even if you don\'t remember to @ "dim the screen to standbye" after doing something like changing a song etc., even the slightest breeze gust of @ wind will active the screens\' features/options/programs and even simply pressing the phone up against your body etc., will do it... you really have to be conscious when using @ "capacitive touchscreens"... but the @ "lightning speed in responses times" is well worth every bit of the nuisance., reducing my stress and impatience from add/adhd from throwing the thing up against the wall etc from waiting even a second or two which seems like an eternity., lulz... another reason why i wanted to break away from traditional @ mp3 players, and try something new!' **** 'second'

---'the only real worries i had when purchasing this; was since i am not activating this on my verizon account with service -- how i would install applications etc., and also how well it would play music... #1) after reading online; i discovered the way manually to download, transfer onto device, and install @ (.apk/.exe) runtime files via a program called @ "astro file" also others as "android file manager", "es file manager", etc., all work good also... so i don\'t need @ internet service and google play app store directly -- which is nice and comforting, albeit more work than clicking a simple install link to the file... #2) i was worried about how well these smartphones in general., and especially this android x in question., would not only just play my music -- but be able to properly @ chronologically and-or alphabetically arrange my files in my personalized folders without ruining the artist-song titles and throwing everything shuffled out of alphabetical order all over the place throughout the folders... when i got this phone and put in my 32gb micro-sd card loaded music, and went to search for and play my music with the motorola droid x\'s built-in @ music player app -- my worst fears were confirmed as this phone\'s system would not recognize the song-track artist and title and alphabetical-listing properly as i loaded everything onto the player., albeit would recognize my personalized folders., and completely destroyed/edited my @ song\'s artist and title with gibberish and randomly scatter my songs out of listing throughout the folder at various points like a mangled car-wreck disaster at 120mph., and but everything would be normal upon connecting device to pc and entering windows o.s desktop again... #3) in response to #2... i went searching online for an alternative @ "music/video player app", and after searching for hours and downloading 8 different music/video-player app -- i finally came upon one program that is the best in my opinion and experience -- called @ ("folder player")., and which handles my folders with songs in artist/track-titles flawlessly as they\'re loaded from the computer as i want them in alphabetical order with needed features such as \'in player option\' of @ delete etc., and a real nice professional stylish "black and white" interface and widget-face to match the motorola android x\'s color "grey and white" scheme... since installing this ("folder player") app; i have been using this motorola android x constantly for hours every day and am in heaven and cannot seem to put it down, lol... i need my music -- it is my life and soul and existence and sanity :)... the phone itself, plays my music superbly without any play-errors or audio-distortions... with @ ("folder player") installed, this has become an excellent alternative to standalone traditional multimedia mp3 players and even digital camcorders and cameras -- and far superior to any traditional @ mp3 player on the market with mass so much extra options to use and in quality also especially... i am very satisfied with this product and my order and highly recommend to others to get one -- if not as an activated serviced @ smartphone, than as an standalone @ "smart multimedia music/video/picture player" by itself alone as an alternative to standard usual \'same-o, same-o\' mp3 players., use the programs like @ "es file manager" etc., to manually install all the apps you want onto the device!!' **** 'able'

---'{{{camera and video quality, type format, and response time}}} the @ "camera and video quality" is great and lighting quick... before i can even finish positioning my hand to different angles etc., the camera and video already recognizes where i am going and gets there first ready to start viewing... the @ "video quality format type" taken and played is hd-720p., and the @ "photo quality format type" taken and viewed is up to hd-8mb... every video and picture taken -- especially in my apartment which is poor lighting., has been virtually crystal clear without any @ "gaussian blur (distorting pixelaration, yellow grain, white grain etc)"., which always seems to occur with both traditional mp3 players and traditional digital cameras... the camera-mode and video-mode and editor options are easy to use and operate... another reason moving from traditional mp3 players, is the fact that these smartphones like this android x by motorola have digital cameras and video camcorders -- so i don\'t have to lug around extra baggage of a camera, camcorder, and music player and have everything ready in one package on the go; plus the hd-quality of the videos and pictures on of this motorola android x is far better than most standalone traditional mp3 players and digital cameras that i have owned and used from $100 and under... i don\'t use cameras and camcorders much; but having them in case i want or need to -- as such when camping, nature hiking, intimate relations, etc-etc-etc., is nice and easing... i don\'t use my smartphones for any video/movie watching; but just having the option too is also nice to have for when if i want or decide too...{{{features}}} this motorola droid x smartphone has tons of programs/features and options -- virtually everything is standard according to mandatory @ "android operating system" requirements., and that you\'ll find on newer generations of technology smartphones such my (lg spectrum 2) or my mother\'s (samsung galaxy s-iii)... when comparing this motorola droid x vs. my lg spectrum 2 or my mother\'s samsung galaxy s-iii; actually there is very little that this motorola droid x doesn\'t have with regards to options and programs/features that newer generations of smartphones don\'t have... among the only things lacking that i can find versus say new generation smartphones such as my lg spectrum 2 for example -- is the lack of any fancy colorful stylish @ "system themes and icons" for the android o.s and is bare/dull system theme of @ "grey w/ on white"... this fact is a bummer; but one of which can easily be rectified with freeware apps in "google app play store" for changing themes such as the @ "go launcher ex" etc... outside the obvious @ motorola android system "theme" and "icons" difference., and also the "chipset-hardware" technology used in the device may no longer be currently produced on the market -- but everything else is still current with regards to the familiar android o.s system structure, aero appearance, and its apps and widgets etc., which is unchanged in newer smartphones e.x.' **** 'little'

---'press and hold down on the screen and pops-up menu for wallpapers, widgets, apps, settings etc-etc-etc... this motorola android x, was released in 2010 and only 4 years old, so its still fairly current technology -- and considered obsolete after around 10-12 years... the physical features itself of the phone includes an @ "mini hdmi to full hdmi tv/monitor port or mini hdmi tv/monitor port" and an red-button for instant @ "camera/camcorder"... it also has your usual controls such as backwards and forwards., options/settings., homescreen (return)., and also the power/dim-screen button...{{{loading files}}} the great things i like about these smartphones, is that they like are majority of traditional @ mp3 player and don\'t really need software... simply connect the phone to windows, and windows automatically installs the driver itself, and you\'re ready to go... one only needs real software for @ firmware upgrades and cloud data backup... once into windows from the desktop after windows installing the driver; simply @ "drag and drop" your files into either the internal hard-drive or external micro-sd card drive and you\'re good to go., and simply go into your particular system app for @ music, photos, videos, etc-etc-etc., to find and use them...' **** 'drive'
---'the only real worries i had when purchasing this; was since i am not activating this on my verizon account with service -- how i would install applications etc., and also how well it would play music... #1) after reading online; i discovered the way manually to download, transfer onto device, and install @ (.apk/.exe) runtime files via a program called @ "astro file" also others as "android file manager", "es file manager", etc., all work good also... so i don\'t need @ internet service and google play app store directly -- which is nice and comforting, albeit more work than clicking a simple install link to the file... #2) i was worried about how well these smartphones in general., and especially this android x in question., would not only just play my music -- but be able to properly @ chronologically and-or alphabetically arrange my files in my personalized folders without ruining the artist-song titles and throwing everything shuffled out of alphabetical order all over the place throughout the folders... when i got this phone and put in my 32gb micro-sd card loaded music, and went to search for and play my music with the motorola droid x\'s built-in @ music player app -- my worst fears were confirmed as this phone\'s system would not recognize the song-track artist and title and alphabetical-listing properly as i loaded everything onto the player., albeit would recognize my personalized folders., and completely destroyed/edited my @ song\'s artist and title with gibberish and randomly scatter my songs out of listing throughout the folder at various points like a mangled car-wreck disaster at 120mph., and but everything would be normal upon connecting device to pc and entering windows o.s desktop again... #3) in response to #2... i went searching online for an alternative @ "music/video player app", and after searching for hours and downloading 8 different music/video-player app -- i finally came upon one program that is the best in my opinion and experience -- called @ ("folder player")., and which handles my folders with songs in artist/track-titles flawlessly as they\'re loaded from the computer as i want them in alphabetical order with needed features such as \'in player option\' of @ delete etc., and a real nice professional stylish "black and white" interface and widget-face to match the motorola android x\'s color "grey and white" scheme... since installing this ("folder player") app; i have been using this motorola android x constantly for hours every day and am in heaven and cannot seem to put it down, lol... i need my music -- it is my life and soul and existence and sanity :)... the phone itself, plays my music superbly without any play-errors or audio-distortions... with @ ("folder player") installed, this has become an excellent alternative to standalone traditional multimedia mp3 players and even digital camcorders and cameras -- and far superior to any traditional @ mp3 player on the market with mass so much extra options to use and in quality also especially... i am very satisfied with this product and my order and highly recommend to others to get one -- if not as an activated serviced @ smartphone, than as an standalone @ "smart multimedia music/video/picture player" by itself alone as an alternative to standard usual \'same-o, same-o\' mp3 players., use the programs like @ "es file manager" etc., to manually install all the apps you want onto the device!!' **** 'music'

---'changing songs, volume levels, turning screen on and off, etc., constantly\' can last almost the entire period of the 24 hour day on audio... sure this will change once the battery is used(charged and uncharged) over time and the battery begins to die(not hold a charge, or a hold limited charge) and need to be replaced... but even with my perplexity for "intermittent operations" of changing songs constantly, flipping through folders, changing volume levels, screen on and screen off etc-etc-etc., every few minutes or seconds -- i still get about @ "8 hours" of audio playback versus about 2-4 hours of standalone mp3 players and most other smartphones... i am very pleased with this!, and when not connected to my apt wall ac-outlet for "continuous power charge" and my dell 100watt 5.1 dolby surround hometheater speakers for "my home stereo system"., whether "14-20 hours of continuous playback" or "8 hours intermittent operation playback" is good enough to get me through the day when not @ home and plugged into the wall when using... this motorola droid x has the greatest "hours of operation" for audio that i have actually ever seen -- both on other smartphones and standalone mp3 players...overall!?' **** 'wall'
