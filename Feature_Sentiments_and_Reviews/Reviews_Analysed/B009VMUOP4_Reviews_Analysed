---"however, there's a separate 4g map below the main coverage map (sneaky and underhanded) that i hadn't noticed before, it's almost as if they're hiding it.but i digress, the reason i decided to return the phone is that even now that i understand their coverage maps, they're still bs.i occasionally get 4g and when i don't i get 1x and this is when in a &#34;home area&#34; where i should be at the very least receiving 3g.no wonder they offer unlimited 3/4g ... you can't get it anywhere!i have a friend who lives in florida and he says metropcs is awesome down there, so results probably vary between locations.if you live in rhode island stay away from metropcs.conclusion;be sure to look at the coverage maps very carefully to be sure you can get the coverage you want in your area, but even then the maps are probably inaccurate ." **** 'separate'

---'between their home coverage, extended coverage, and travel talk area (see the metro pcs coverage map for clarification), coverage for voice and text in the us (and in a few parts of canada, so their coverage map says) is pretty well covered or at least as good if not better than the big 4 (for overall us coverage).' **** 'overall'
