---"this is a net10 phone and my experience with there customer support reps have not been good, so i think it's fair to say that they have bad customer support, they have extremely long hold time, also the reps are not as knowledgeable as they should be, i have been having some technically issues with this phone, and the customer support could not figure out what was wrong so my phone still has the same issues it's very frustrating since i just purchased the phone, and i naturally expected everything to work as advertised but i wasn't so lucky.4.the buttons on the phone are really small and my fingers are pretty small5.if you breath too hard on the phone it leaks minutes, and if you think too heard on the phone it leaks minutes lol just a little joke, but very, very true net10 has various plans to fit your budget, but no matter what plan you get there service is set in such a way that it takes a lot of minutes just to lightly use the phone6.this phone occasionally fails to send & receive picture message, i have had this phone for over 12 months now since first posting this review & this model phone has become more annoying then useful due to the errors & other annoyancesi recommend buying this phone unlocked and choosing another service provider, but keep in mind that you may still experience the texting related errors discussed in line 6, make sure you consider your options carefully before buying this cell model thanks for reading." **** 'bad'

---'i recommend the first thing you do when you get this phone is to get you a micro sd card.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'one other thing, the phone will default to saving things to the tiny internal memory (less than 50mb), so if you plan on using a microsd card with it (up to 4gb supported i believe), make sure you change the default saving location by going into settings >> memory info.' **** 'other'
