Negative Reviews:

---"i'ts hard to compare every high range smartphone on market right now, because every user have different tastes and expectations between a brand or another, but i think thi cellphone qualifies between the best of the best, the sense operating system is really more efficient than samsung versi&oacute;n of android, for example, and features between this and a galaxy s4 are pretty much the same, for my personal taste, this one has a better cam and way better audio, and hast the kit kat 4.4. update, so i like this one much more, if i compare it even to nexus 5, it's an overall better cellphone, has a smaller processor, but better features on pretty much everything else." **** 'better'
