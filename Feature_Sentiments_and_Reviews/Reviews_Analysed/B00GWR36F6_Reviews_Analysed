Positive Reviews:

---'using it on telus network here in quebec ,canada.no problem since i bought it.blazing fast compare to the crappy phone i had before.i love it and i even got android 4.4.3 last friday (june 6) in the update...you cant go wrong with the moto g at least for me.i would recommend to anybody on a budget.'
---'if one day the camera issue is resolved, it will be a killer phone in the industry.i bought a moto g for my younger daughter to replace her old ipod touch and thinking about buying a more expensive moto x from republic wireless for my elder daughter so she can call in wifi only environment (in her school, the t-mobile signal is totally blocked, but the wifi is strong) and outside where there is wireless signal.'
---"motorola really seems to be taking the bull by the horns with their budget and mid-tier phone initiatives.overall, i am very happy with the moto g. it lacks some of the bells and whistles of its higher end siblings, but if you're looking for a great entry to mid-level smart phone that is fairly fast, with good battery life and, best of all, a presently unbeatable price for its features, i can definitely recommend the moto g. 4/5 stars."
---'my 14 and 12 year old girls love their new moto gs....they were the right price for an unlocked phone.'
---"lower system requirements ultimately means a much smoother performance than previous versions of android, and that is certainly true of the moto g. i've yet to run into any major hiccups with this device in any apps.- rock-solid build quality and design."
---'4.4.2 kikat has been available for the moto g in the us since dec 19, my device got it on jan 15.'
---'for work i use a moto x and this phone &#34;feels&#34; like the x but it most notably lacks the active display and the always on mic.if you are into phone, i would recommend the moto x (has gone on sale for 350) or the nexus 5 but if you are on a budget, or if you are like my wife and really do not care, you cannot go wrong with the moto g.'
---'unfortunately, only the gsm version of the moto g was available rather than a cdma version, forcing me to move to the att world and purchase a sim card from st.  first of all, this is an excellent phone for people like me that use their phone for daily lower bandwidth applications such as email, texts, navigation, news, calendaring, google music or pandora and the occasional youtube video.'
---"i'd hoped when i read the reviews of the original moto g that they'd come up with a 4g/lte model with provision for added storage, and they did!"
---'i would have been better off with the normal moto g, which much to my chagrin, is also cheaper.from my browsings online, i discovered that motorola is aware of this sd card issue and will be addressing it in the latest kit kat update for the moto g 4g.'
---"motorola must have cut some corners to get the price of the moto g so low, and the camera is one area which has seen the compromise.the 5mp lens is simply not up to the job and my photos either came out blurry, grainy or both, while the camera app itself will be far too basic for some.the lack of expandable memory will be a real bug bear for some, especially if you end up with the 8gb model and it's missing the more recent tech advances in the form of nfc and 4g.final verdict:the moto g is a top notch, low cost smartphone and i wholeheartedly recommend this as the best budget mobile currently on the market.i was genuinely impressed with the feature set on the moto g, so if you're looking for a low cost phone you can stop searching - just go out and grab a moto g right now."
---'outside of a few bells and whistles....this phone is just as good as the moto x for a normal non-techie user.'
---'if you are looking for a quality phone on the cheap, you cant go wrong with the moto g. for just 200$ you are getting a quad-core, well built phone, that can make sweat a high-range phone.pd: buy the 16gb version cause the phone has no external storage.'
---"i'm not sure if the original moto g had the same camera sensor, or the 4g lte variation got a demoted sensor -- but for the price, the picture quality could definitely be better."

Negative Reviews:

---'if getting the highest quality pictures from your phone is a priority for you, this might not be your phone.internal storage - decreased to 8gb from the 16gb offered in the original moto g.  the addition of the micro sd card slot helps by allowing media and pictures to be offloaded, but for those who install many apps or large games, internal storage might start to get tight.'
---'the moto g also came pre-installed with google now, which i have found very useful for speaking google search queries, setting alarms, to-dos and other day-to-day tasks, like checking the weather- this, for me, is much faster than using the screen for such functions.battery life on the moto g is like night and day compared to my razr.'
---'google is also offering 50gb of google drive space for moto g owners who need more than the stock internal memory.moto g also feels comfortable to hold.'
---'here\'s a list of what i find impressive:screen: reminiscent of my nexus 7 in colors and crispness, and the 4.5" size is a perfect compromise for the pocketbattery life: offering two days per charge for my settings and usage patternsform factor: easy to hold, light enough, with durable plastic that requires no case over itspeed: kit-kat runs very fast, well-optimized for the slower chipset, just a little slower than my nexus 7speaker: loud, clear, and placed on the back (not the bottom like my iphone, where my finger sometimes blocked it)software: no bloat, and the helpful moto apps make this version better than google play version, imocall quality: fine so farcell/wi-fi/gps radios: have always found a signal quickly, no drops yet after a monthcamera: honestly haven\'t taken one photo yet, but good to know there isn\'t a battery drain bug here like on the nexus 5in a battle of low-midrange phones, the moto g beats my iphone 4s in every possible way.'
---'?well, i guess you can buy a smartphone with same features as moto g but with more than 200 $ with lg, samsung, htc, sony, huawei.pro:-price 200$ moto g 16 gb-googledrive 50 gb-latest android updates, 4.4.3 available.-good specifications quadcore snapdragon 400, 1 gb ram, 16gb stored and moto g can handle with the newest games.-comfortable.-right size.-battery is good, 2 full days without charge it but if you do not play games or listen music, i usually used whatsapp, chrome, some apps and the battery is really really good.cons:-no micro sd expandable.'
---"moto g, on the other hand, does not fall behind on the performance front, and still delivers around a full day- that's 24 hours, not a 'business day'-of usage, screen time around four to six hours, higher if i'm not doing anything too processor intensive, and remain within wifi zone like my work place.granted, sometimes i miss the ability to download things at lte speeds, but i think i'm willing to trade slower (but certainly serviceable) data transfer speeds over freedom of being away from charger as long as i want without nary a compromise.i've shopped around for quite a bit, and i'm pretty confident that moto g is about the only phone that delivers such level of performance and longevity at the price point."
---"while the viewing angle for the moto g's ips screen isn't very good, it's actually sharper than the moto x amoled screen and have smoother colors (less color banding)."
---'overall, i am very satisfied with the moto g.  plan to buy several more for the rest of the family.'
---"i really loved this moto g i bought less than a month ago, a really fully functional mobile office for me.just one problem, yesterday after less than a month since i got it the screen display started to flicker and after less than 24 hours it's almost impossible to see anything on the screen.began the long process of sending to repair, hope it will end soon and well.it's a good product, but once something goes wrong trust in the brand and product really is a problem.maybe it's just me."
---"i'm not sure if the original moto g had the same camera sensor, or the 4g lte variation got a demoted sensor -- but for the price, the picture quality could definitely be better."
---"i hope this comment doesn't get deleted, because amazon sells the x for quite a bit more.if you're interested in the moto x, the essential differences are these: (1) x is a bit more powerful; (2) x has 4g while g only 3g; (3) x has a 10mpixel camera to the g's 5mp; (4) the x can pick up both the 1700 and the 1900 band, so you don't have to decide between the &#34;us&#34; version and the &#34;global&#34; version of the phone."
---'this thing is a speedy little handset that will be more than adequate for the average user and i think if you are a power user that needs your phone to be productive, the moto g should be able to handle everything you throw at it.not only does the quad-core processor and 1gb of ram in this little beast zip, but it is a true battery sipper.'
---"really great i think.i think if you want the best, than the moto x, for someone who doesn't really know all the features of smartphones and wants the luck of a  nice smartphone, moto g. im sure there are lots of features other phones have that this doesn't, but it has all the important ones people generally know about.i think if your new to smart phones, and don't want to be tied into expensive contracts, this is the phone, just don't break it, get a case like otterbox."
