---'5" 720p overall, but I had to comment on just how rich and beautiful the Moto G display is.' **** 'overall'
---'5" size is a perfect compromise for the pocketBattery life: offering two days per charge for my settings and usage patternsForm factor: easy to hold, light enough, with durable plastic that requires no case over itSpeed: Kit-Kat runs very fast, well-optimized for the slower chipset, just a little slower than my Nexus 7Speaker: loud, clear, and placed on the back (not the bottom like my iPhone, where my finger sometimes blocked it)Software: no bloat, and the helpful Moto apps make this version better than Google Play version, IMOCall quality: fine so farCell/wi-fi/GPS radios: have always found a signal quickly, no drops yet after a monthCamera: honestly haven\'t taken one photo yet, but good to know there isn\'t a battery drain bug here like on the Nexus 5In a battle of low-midrange phones, the Moto G beats my iPhone 4S in every possible way.' **** 'helpful'

---"While the viewing angle for the Moto G's IPS screen isn't very good, it's actually sharper than the Moto X AMOLED screen and have smoother colors (less color banding)." **** 'sharper'
---'Overall: I recommend spending a little more to get the Moto G LTE version over the 3G version.' **** 'overall'
---'Overall, I am very satisfied with the Moto G. Plan to buy several more for the rest of the family.' **** 'overall'
---'My biggest worry about Moto G was that it comes with 3G where as the other two are 4G.' **** 'other'
---"I'm not sure if the original Moto G had the same camera sensor, or the 4G LTE variation got a demoted sensor -- but for the price, the picture quality could definitely be better." **** 'original'
---"If you're interested in the Moto X, the essential differences are these: (1) X is a bit more powerful; (2) X has 4G while G only 3G; (3) X has a 10Mpixel camera to the G's 5MP; (4) The X can pick up both the 1700 and the 1900 band, so you don't have to decide between the &#34; US&#34; version and the &#34; Global&#34; version of the phone." **** 'interested'
---"I think if you want the best, than the MOTO X, for someone who doesn't really know all the features of smartphones and wants the luck of a  NICE smartphone, MOTO G. Im sure there are lots of features other phones have that this doesn't, but it has all the important ones people generally know about." **** 'best'
---'Design : I usually like to put three paragraphs of each and maybe not find one , the design of Motorola Moto G is correct and is enhanced by its cover cases colors, but perhaps the quality of some finishes , buttons and even margins excessive - specific lower - make a good intention to remain in that, in intention , and not get out of being a simple design and a somewhat heavy terminal.' **** 'correct'

---'If you are into phone, I would recommend the moto x (has gone on sale for 350) or the nexus 5 but if you are on a budget, or if you are like my wife and really do not care, you cannot go wrong with the Moto G. Battery without using very much, and sometimes the phone will continue to heat.' **** 'wrong'
---'When I was done I sold it and ended up getting most of my money back but when my contract is up my next phone will almost certianly be a Moto G. They have this phone on Republic Wireless now, Republic is a really low cost carrier in the US my Dad asked me what the difference between this and the more expensive Moto X is.' **** 'expensive'

Negative Reviews:

---'5" size is a perfect compromise for the pocketBattery life: offering two days per charge for my settings and usage patternsForm factor: easy to hold, light enough, with durable plastic that requires no case over itSpeed: Kit-Kat runs very fast, well-optimized for the slower chipset, just a little slower than my Nexus 7Speaker: loud, clear, and placed on the back (not the bottom like my iPhone, where my finger sometimes blocked it)Software: no bloat, and the helpful Moto apps make this version better than Google Play version, IMOCall quality: fine so farCell/wi-fi/GPS radios: have always found a signal quickly, no drops yet after a monthCamera: honestly haven\'t taken one photo yet, but good to know there isn\'t a battery drain bug here like on the Nexus 5In a battle of low-midrange phones, the Moto G beats my iPhone 4S in every possible way.' **** 'helpful'
---"That said, the plastics aren't as nice as the Moto X - they collect smudges a lot easier, and the black version never looks clean." **** 'nice'
---"While the viewing angle for the Moto G's IPS screen isn't very good, it's actually sharper than the Moto X AMOLED screen and have smoother colors (less color banding)." **** 'sharper'
---"If you're interested in the Moto X, the essential differences are these: (1) X is a bit more powerful; (2) X has 4G while G only 3G; (3) X has a 10Mpixel camera to the G's 5MP; (4) The X can pick up both the 1700 and the 1900 band, so you don't have to decide between the &#34; US&#34; version and the &#34; Global&#34; version of the phone." **** 'interested'
---'I also purchased and returned a Moto X about a month ago and similarly, while the G is not technically as good as the X, it is a better phone in my opinion.' **** 'good'
---"What is more noticeable is that the Moto X's display has better contrast--whites are much whiter and blacks are blacker." **** 'noticeable'
---"I think if you want the best, than the MOTO X, for someone who doesn't really know all the features of smartphones and wants the luck of a  NICE smartphone, MOTO G.
