---'what is remarkable is that i did not have to scale the video down, i played the same file that i would have played on my laptop and it played perfectly.this is very interesting to me since treo is going to do an update supporting 2gig sd cards, and  possibly a sd card mass storage interface.11.' **** 'interesting'
---'this resolves my one major negative with the treo 700p and i am one happy camper.' **** 'negative'

__________('device',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i beleive that the reason the ratings average for this device is around 2.5 instead of 0 is that the concept and layout of this device is so good and useful.' **** 'good'
---'after finding out what it could do, i got it right away, but be wary of getting this device.' **** 'wary'
---"it's a shame because this would be a spectacular device, worthy of a 5-star rating, if it worked.update - received my 3rd treo 700p from verizon 2 weeks ago." **** 'spectacular'

Negative Reviews:

---'sync is a pain to setup when using versamail.overall, i would love to throw this phone in the bottom of the atlantic ocean, its the worst electronic device i have ever owned.' **** 'worst'


================================================================================================================
__________('call',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'for example, i will start a call, touch the speakerphone button, then have to wait several seconds until the speakerphone starts.' **** 'touch'
---'after hot syncing old data, i found the interface, and several features including; "find", application switching, and sms text messaging to be noticeably slower on the treo 700p than on the older treo 600.  additionally, i have had the phone "freeze" up immediately after sending a text message (at times more than 5 minutes), as well as being unable to answer a call because of freezing up when attempting to switch between sms and phone applications.' **** 'unable'
---'forget it with this thing, it is rediculous how long it takes to place a second call, and there no redial function, you have to go to the call log screen and redial from there - and even if you have it on speedial it is no faster.the phone has crashed or spontaneously restarted when i was right in the middle of something so many times that i lost count long ago.' **** 'second'

Negative Reviews:

---'i have lost count of the number of times i have returned this model for an exchange due to increasing frequency of freeze-ups, random restarts, delayed responses to number and program entries (which have led to being unable to hang up a call, erasing voice mail unintentionally, standing there like an idiot when called upon for information that i thought i had readily available to me) and an overall inability to depend on this phone as a part of my professional and personal lifestyle.' **** 'unable'

---"i have missed several important calls this way (expecting a call, like for a job, and it finally comes, but you miss it, and by the time you work through the slow process of returning the call it can be busy when they are calling someone else - just one example of the type of call you can expect to miss).i missed fully siding it into my shorts pocket one time this summer and it fell on the floor, the vibrate has never worked since (i am only 5 foot 7 so it wasn't much of a fall).when entering your passcode for voicemail, or entering numbers in one of those systems like when paying the phone bill or utility bill over the phone, it is not unlikely that the numbers you enter will be read back to you wrong." **** 'busy'

__________('much', 'better')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'word has it the 755p is back up to about what the old 650 used to be--which is kinda embarassing right there if you ask me.camera is much better than the 650...but 1.3mp??' **** 'much'
---'also, while the resolution is much better, in places where the lighting is even remotely less than on a clear summer day outdoors, the photos come out looking like you took them inside a closet.' **** 'much'
---'palm os has been around for a long time and should perform much better by now.' **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---'i have taken off any "extra" third-party software as advised by palm, and it still freezes!' **** 'extra'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the phone is 3 days old and i have done 3 soft resets and 4 hard resets.the first two days were great, no problems.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---"it doesn't take long to fill up with the amount of stuff that is available these days, so i gotta wonder about that.i read about pairing problems between the 700p and bluetooth headsets and sure 'nuff mine was problematic, too." **** 'available'
---"for example, your screen shows that you entered 12345, but the system reads back that you entered 12354 - this happens on a regular basis and on totally unrelated phone systems.i called sprint a couple of months after i bought it because i heard that insurance is offered on phones, on of course they told me you have to have to get it in the first 30 days - of course no one told me that when i bought it, likely because they lose so much money replacing the pieces of junk that they don't want to tell anyone.ever try to win something by calling into a radio station?" **** 'first'
---"to experienced palm users, your current software will probably work, but if you haven't kept up with the patches and updates, you may need to add patches or upgrade to newer version.battery life is ok but not outstanding, you need to recharge every night if you can; certainly every couple of days, if possible." **** 'possible'

__________('mail',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'this "push" is similar to using the "check for new mail" now rather than your suggested at a minimum five (5) minute wait time.9.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:



================================================================================================================
__________('calls',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'however, i never made it past 3 calls at which point i had to delete the "trusted" device and repair the connection.' **** 'past'
---"in fact, i assumed, perhaps it was because i had it set to load the previous page when i open the browser - that's not the problem - even if i have it set to a blank page it still hangs - as if it loads the previous page in the background anyway.i often loose calls because it simply reboots in the middle of a conversation - with heavy usage this was happening at least once a week.opening a simple text sms message can sometimes take 10-30 seconds - or as much as a minute - for no apparant reason.this phone just sucks, unless you specifically need palm programs, just get a blackberry, they are much better." **** 'loose'
---'while the stylus or the keyboard can be used to dial, you can also use the touch pad to scroll through recent calls or contacts with one hand it and redials no problem.1.2  bluetoothi use a bluetooth headset quite a bit and it works 95% of the time.' **** 'recent'
---'the number of dropped calls has significantly decreased.' **** 'dropped'

Negative Reviews:

---"the entire button layout seems more stable than before and after pressing the button, i can't say for certain, but it seems there is a more obvious *click* feel to it that the 650 lacked, making this a giant leap ahead in my opinion.receiving calls is much the same as before as palm simply refuses to do almost any upgrades in the operating system for fear the learning curve may be too much for us (sounds as good as any other reason i've heard...).i do like the new *ignore with text* feature that comes along with each incoming call allowing you the option to at least let the caller know you recognize that they called you but you cannot answer right away." **** 'much'
---'i was able to make calls but could not receive calls.' **** 'able'
---'this is unacceptable when attempting to receive or make calls, using voice mail features during the call (essentially attempting to perform a function with the phone while it is in a state of non-response), and/or receiving/sending text messages.' **** 'unacceptable'
---"i have missed several important calls this way (expecting a call, like for a job, and it finally comes, but you miss it, and by the time you work through the slow process of returning the call it can be busy when they are calling someone else - just one example of the type of call you can expect to miss).i missed fully siding it into my shorts pocket one time this summer and it fell on the floor, the vibrate has never worked since (i am only 5 foot 7 so it wasn't much of a fall).when entering your passcode for voicemail, or entering numbers in one of those systems like when paying the phone bill or utility bill over the phone, it is not unlikely that the numbers you enter will be read back to you wrong." **** 'important'
---'the echo present during calls was hard to endure on both sides of the call.' **** 'hard'
---'i also experienced a large number of dropped calls.' **** 'dropped'
