---"experience indicates my daughter can go over 3 months on 1420 minutes, so the monthly cost is less than $30.3) has a true qwerty keyboardcons:1) touch screen is hinky -- the one time i used it i found it virtually impossible to scroll2) not a 3g phone; not even sure if it's 2.53) keyboard is cramped compared to that of the samsung 404g, but it doesn't seem to stop my daughter from using it4) the phone feels quite solid and not at all junky, but given the other cons i don't think it's worth 90 bucks -- especially since for that money you can get a low-end touch screen android phone from virgin mobile (though, admittedly, by doing so you're giving up verizon for vm's parent, sprint -- not a good swap)" **** 'touch'

Positive Reviews:

---"i bought this as a replacement for my old lg 500g, because it has a qwerty keyboard (i'm still not ready to go strictly touch-screen) and it had excellent reviews.but i'm a bit disappointed, as there's no video recorder, you can't watch videos, and you can't download games for it and transfer them from your computer (all things i could do with my old 500g).web surfing is also clunkier as i can't even seem to access popular websites like twitter on it (even after downloading the opera mini browser).and the photo quality of the camera is worse than the one on my old motorola flip phone that i had over five years ago (there doesn't even seem to be a zoom feature!)." **** 'worse'
