---"when buying this phone i was definititely looking for a phone that had all the options and features you would ever want even if it was a little pricy......the resolution, speakers, radio,mp3player,photo caller id, and even the camera are some of the best ive seen on most phones...i have a sony cybershot digital camera and the camera on this phone practically measures up in quality.....spending the extra money was definitely worth it for this sony ericsson walkman phone.....honestly sony ericsson phones are all pretty good and last longthere are seriosuly only 2 cons that this phone has...otherwise i think it is the best phone out there for neone who loves technology, music, and absolute best qualitycon 1: is that for a phone that is this pricy you would think that it would let you use all your ringtones, meaning a different ringtone for everyone in your phone book.....i mean the memory card is great and you can download all your favortire mp3 songs which you can use as ringtone(i edit mine first to my fav part of a song plays only)...the thing is the ringtone or mp3 you choose is for all your calls....the only tones you can set to each individual person in your phone book are the ones taht come with the phone...that is a little lame since friends of mine who have way cheaper quality phones can set a different ringtone for each person in their book.....either way you can't beat the speaker quality on this phone when u jsut listen to your music or here a ringtone...it makes you jumpcon 2: is that even though you have radio you cant use it unless your special headset which comes with the phone is plugged in since it works as the antenna for radio.....not a big deal but annoying that is has to hang off your phone for you to listen to radiooverall: the best phone ive ever purchased....the one time makin an expensive purchase is worth every penny!most important: if you buy this phone go to a store that sells it unlocked and dont order it...mainly since this phone isn't at any company you have serice with when you put ur sim card in the store has to setup certain things...the main thing is if you have internet it won't transfer and you provider wont help you since the phone is unlocked so make sure you have the people at the store set everything up for you" **** 'main'
