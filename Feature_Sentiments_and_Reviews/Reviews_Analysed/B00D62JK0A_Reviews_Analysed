Negative Reviews:

---'the headphones are good but have too much bass for me personally.cons:1) this device has very limited internal storage, user available is 1.64gb out of the box... however since this phone has a micro sd card slot and they allow you to install apps to the sd card, there really is no need to take a star away, people report some 64gb cards working (i have not tried) but if this is true then you really have no reason to complain about storage.2) accessories can be tough to find, try searching for symphony w150, allview v1 viper, general mobile discovery, polytron w8470, fly iq4410 quad phoenix, qmobile noir a900 accessories as they should work for the blu life play as well.update con #3) the camera is terrible in low light.' **** 'good'

---'my sd card still has plenty of storage space.' **** 'plenty'
---'but to use the review system properly i will tell you the pros and cons of the device.pros: *it has a large crisp screen, the battery will last an entire day of heavy use and still have about 40% remaining (so not quite a two day usage), the camera on the phone is pretty nice but if your looking to get any nice zoomed in pictures it not that reliable, probably the best feature on this phone is the lack of bloatware.now before i say any cons remember that there will be far more problems mentioned simply because it is much easier to find the bad things in a product rather than the good.cons: the internal storage is very small so it almost essential that you get a large sd card.' **** 'small'
