Positive Reviews:

---"the outer display doesn't even show when the phone is not in use and gets annoying when you try to use it as a clock and have to open it everytime.battery life is horrible, it lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes for me on a fully charged battery until it died, this is unacceptable in my book.sound quality is very poor and whenever you talk into it you hear your own voice in the ear part of the phone which gets really annoying after about one minute.reception is certainly not the best, the motorola e815 that i got now gets full reception in places that this thing couldn't even find a signal.the interface is ugly and cannot be changed the red verizon bars on the top and bottom need to go and i like motorolas interface much better.the ok button needs to be changed so that it is raised up or something because everytime you try to hit it you end up hitting one of the arrows instead.so there you have it that is why i didn't like this phone at all and returned it after two days for an e815 which by the way i am more than happy with." **** 'top'

Positive Reviews:

---"verizons rectified this problem with other past phones released with this conversion needed and has readded mp3 playback in recent releases...the v3m will most likely never see that fix...sidenote:appearently this is a razr thing...not sure about the lg's or samsungs..but appearently verizon didnt totally erase evidence of the motorola ui on here as its more of a hybrid of the motorola ui overwritten by verizon...a nice touch really :).so theres my review of the razr v3m for verizon." **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"well, after reading good reviews about the razr in various magazines and online i decided that i would get one since i was switching back to verizon after having cingular for 3 years, what a mistake!prosthere really are no good things about this phone, some may like it because it is thin but i did't even like that aspect.consthe first problem i noticed with this phone is that it takes forever to turn on." **** 'first'
---'my 3 year old nokia i had from cingular turned on and could place a call within 5 seconds, beat that razr.the second problem is that when you turn the phone off it makes a stupid sound that cannot be turned off or muted and is quite annoying.the thinness of the phone causes your hand to cramp up after about two minutes of use.the display on this phone sucks and is impossible to see in sunlight no matter which way you try to face it.' **** 'second'

Positive Reviews:

---"it's not a bad player, but you can't do mp3's with verizon, they need to be converted to wma files first and then transferred to be able to play them on the phone, which they are much bigger then mp3's.overall, for the phone i give it five stars, but because it's with verizon i only give it four." **** 'bad'
---'everything that you want extra costs, i thought that this phone worked as an mp3 player that is easy to figure out, vz hates mac.' **** 'easy'
