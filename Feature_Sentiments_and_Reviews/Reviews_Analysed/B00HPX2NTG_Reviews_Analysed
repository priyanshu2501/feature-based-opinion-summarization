---"this isn't a huge problem as it encourages me to keep aware of what features i have turned on, although i sometimes forget i don't have a feature turned on when checking my air-time or pairing w/ my bluetooth device.i downloaded the tracfone app to keep track of my balances for talk-time, data & texts, although i do wish they would just have that info easily available on the home screen (as on their other conventional phones), as one has to connect through either wi-fi or 3g data to obtain this info." **** 'aware'
---"the lg optimus dynamic ii seemed to have the best features of the smart phones offered by tracfone.it came with a 4gb micro sd card which can be changed out for up to 32gb.it also has gps tracking which allows you to use navigation programs without using cell data.apps can also be downloaded from google play.the phone doesn't have the fastest processor available, but it is adequate and the cost for using a tracfone can be much less than having a phone through a contract service provider." **** 'best'

---')my smartphone review or views will be influenced by just having had the lg 800 and the zte valet, this is a true smartphone like the zte valet, unlike my lg 800.i must say that i think this new (entry level) lg optimus ii will be very popular with tracfone users that are (wanting) to get into the smartphone experience.this is a review on the phone and not on tracfone,verizon or amazon,some other reviews cover them.as i wrote this review there was totally no review information here,the question and answer page was empty so i tried to put something in here for everyone and the review had gotten pretty long but there should be something here to help you,thanks for your patients.lets start out with the larger screen,for me,i found it does make a difference,there is more area to work with.i put both the the valet and the lg optimus ii on the local channel 10 tv app  and you could see the difference the larger, clearer  3.8inch  screen has made reading the small print.' **** 'clearer'
---'the case or cover will also cut back on the scratches, fingerprints from the high gloss black back cover and give it some protection.update, phone just feels better in my hand with case on it.there are four no backlit capacitive touch buttons or keys at the bottom of the phone for the( >back key >home key,>menu key,>recent app key ).the keys are highly reflective which  may or may not help in some cases to see them, but not having the lighted touch buttons was a big disappointment.you do have very quick positive feedback from the touch buttons and buttons or tabs on the screen > could this be because of the larger screen area has made the buttons or tabs larger and easier to touch?everything seems to work smoother, more responsive, better than the valet  which i really like and am still using.' **** 'larger'
---'*make sure to keep (gps,wifi,sync,bluetooth) off when you can to save you battery,look in comments for more battery saving tips.the battery just will not last as long as your old style tracfones because there are just too many features to play with,larger screen, all of those apps.three days at the best on the battery for myself.i miss the camera flash that the zte valet had that i used for a  flashlight by installing an app from the google app store.' **** 'larger'
---'the screen is bright enough the see in the sunlight and dark enough to watch at night.' **** 'bright'
---'battery icon is visible on screen when cable is first plugged in, but disappears when screen sleeps (you can keep checking by pressing the power button...or choose "stay awake" in settings).new "recent apps" capacitive button is cool...but the "clear all" button is too large and easy to accidentally press.the od2 looks sleek.' **** 'first'
---'but after 10 days, 3/4 of the screen went black, meaning phone was basically useless.' **** 'black'
---'the screen is still two small for my fat fingers  but we did buy a stylus for each phone to help texting and surfing the internet.' **** 'small'
---'the screen is bigger than the iphone, but small enough that the lack of resolution is not a big issue.' **** 'bigger'
---'the screen is clear but could be way better, you can see small pixels up close on the screen so if you wanna get this phone or are thinking about this phone just keep that in mind that you are not getting any thing close to an hd display.' **** 'clear'
---"(i'm 62), and somehow they disconnected my number (which might have somehow been at&t;'s fault), so ...i switched to a star trek style flip phone with tracfone, but quickly realized that i still wanted to learn some android, so ...i upgraded to one of their android phones, but sometimes, when i'd press one key on the screen, i would get a character from the other side of the screen, so ...i ordered this lg optimus dynamic ii phone from amazon, then went online to tracfone's toll-free number to move the number from one phone to the other, and though it took most of the day for tracfone custserv to finish the job, it was done to my satisfaction.my only complaint is that i have to turn on the speakerphone to hear more clearly, but that's not lg's fault." **** 'key'
