---'my wife likes the size, i could do with a bigger screen but the nice thing is this one will slip in a shirt or pants pocket easily.' **** 'bigger'
---"this phone has so many great features (everything i wanted except a built-in fm transmitter - i couldn't find any android phones i could buy in the u.s. with one built in and didn't want to go to nokia/symbian).i am one of those rare individuals who has a smartphone with no data plan, so the wi-fi was really critical to me, but i've found that often the lack of data plan hinders me from actually using this phone, since most android apps seem to require data access.i didn't really think this would be as much of an issue as it was since i was moving up from a smaller screen on a qwerty-less phone, but the screen is really quite tiny and i often find myself hitting the wrong button because of the lack of finger precision (i have very slim fingers, too).one thing i didn't know until i owned this phone that i run into constantly is that most android apps will default to being installed/upgraded on the internal hard drive and that some applications just won't install to an external storage card, which is probably fine except for the fact that this phone has a very tiny internal hard drive and if you go too long without connecting to data or wi-fi, all of your upgrades will try to run at once and then they will all fail because there isn't enough space on the hard drive for them all at the same time.the screen lock is a little iffy as far as not wearing down the battery, but once i had a hard case that covered up the screen, that wasn't really an issue for me." **** 'smaller'
