---'not too wide either, despite the screen size, due to the thin bezel.- i also like the physical home button (capacitive touch on gs2 and inspire)- lte and nfc capability, which our older phones lacked- charges fast with included power adapter- battery has so far lasted all day for me on one charge- faster hardware, which results in fast, smooth performance when using the phone- the ir blaster i really like, for controlling the tv and pretty much any other device that uses an ir remote- it takes great pictures for a phone, with a 13mp camera.' **** 'due'

---"the phone comes with a ton of bloatware from at&t;(i don't know about other carriers but i assume it's the same) and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware." **** 'good'
---'the snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the s3.' **** 'less'
---"but i'll admit it does have a certain visual appeal to it, and my friends that aren't that particular really enjoy it.- microsd cart slot and removable battery: the inclusion of the microsd card slot for me is a nice plus, since i can just load on a bunch of movies and tv shows to watch on the go (can't do that over the cellular network because of data caps)." **** 'removable'
---"the removable battery means that you can swap it out if you want in the middle of the day, but i've never been one to buy multiple batteries personally." **** 'removable'
---"you can buy increased capacity batteries after-market to help alleviate the battery issue, though i can't comment on their quality or performance." **** 'alleviate'
---"now that android version 4.3 got announced we can see how long they'll take for an update.overall, i'd say the sgs4 definitely fulfills the solid camera performance criterion, does well-enough on the display quality, and offers about average battery life with options to improve it without having to buy a bulky add-on case." **** 'average'

---')+great keyboard with numerical row always displayed (thanks to the large screen)+the phone is very fast+gps lock is very good+even without gps enabled the phone is capable of determining its position fairly accurately and very quickly+battery life is reasonable (galaxy s2 standard battery life was abysmal)+voice recognition - astounded at the level of the voice recognition - it is definitely no longer a gimmick+loud speaker with little distortion+two built-in microphones (i can talk to people with my phone on the desk in the speakerphone mode with no problems)+vibration feature when you pick up the phone and you had a missed callcons:+no dedicated search button like on s2 (it is not a dealbreaker but the button saved many useless clicks and motions in os and apps)+navigating the ui is harder with the larger screen by using only one hand+a lot of the touted extra features such as smart motion, smart stay, smart pause and so forth are mostly gimmicks due to poor implementation or redundancy' **** 'larger'

Negative Reviews:

---'oh iphone, i miss your usability, smaller size and my music.' **** 'smaller'
---'not too wide either, despite the screen size, due to the thin bezel.- i also like the physical home button (capacitive touch on gs2 and inspire)- lte and nfc capability, which our older phones lacked- charges fast with included power adapter- battery has so far lasted all day for me on one charge- faster hardware, which results in fast, smooth performance when using the phone- the ir blaster i really like, for controlling the tv and pretty much any other device that uses an ir remote- it takes great pictures for a phone, with a 13mp camera.' **** 'due'
