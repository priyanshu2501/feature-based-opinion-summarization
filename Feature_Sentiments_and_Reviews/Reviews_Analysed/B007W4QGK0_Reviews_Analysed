---"thank you lg for making a great phone for those of us that just want to talk, text, and occasionally send or view a picture text.this is the best phone i've ever had that didn't require data service.great touchscreen, great options, great battery life.tech-unsavvy people may not like the touch screen or all the setup options.but tech savvy people that don't need/want a smartphone will really enjoy this phone." **** 'touch'
---'you cannot operate the touch screen on many phones while wearing gloves, but this one works fine.' **** 'touch'
---'if the phone is asleep, all you do is swipe (light touch) the screen and it wakes up and can make a call.' **** 'light'
---"the only way to make it work is to enter a seperate contact for each phone number, not for each person.if you hit a wrong number when dialing and hit the back arrow to correct it, it enters a 3.  you have to hit just above the back arrow to actually use it to delete.if you have the keypad on the touch screen and slide out the keyboard, the screen says it's dialing." **** 'touch'
