__________('screen',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'however, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- the directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.' **** 'past'
---'the only downside is that you cant store multiple phone numbers under one name but rather have to list the same person over and over if you want to enter home,cell,bus number etc...the screen is all black so it tends to get messy with facial oil stains but big deal....the phone is slick and reliable....best for out of the usa use.....i strongly recommend it.' **** 'black'

Negative Reviews:

---'the only negative that i have found which i think has been mentioned is that the screen and keypad pick up oil from your face very easily.' **** 'negative'
---'often, when i flip it open, the screen is crazy (cut in half or bright green or only showing part of the functions).' **** 'open'
---"in fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone's highest resolution." **** 'good'
