Positive Reviews:

---'i got this phone for my self and it sucks just like the one mentioned in the tittle of this review.here in amazon says it is 4g,but it really is 3g,and even worse,with the sim card of t-mobile only works in 2g,making everything really slow and not able to make video chat calls.the reception 4g,is not as described  in amazon or in the box.it has two batteries because this type of phone drains the battery really quick even with all the applications stopped.for someone that enjoy music,use it like gps and use applications,is no good because it drain the battery right away,' **** 'worse'

---'phone is awesome only thing is you need a sims card from straight talk before you can use it and the volume is not loud at all.' **** 'straight'
---'the item was delivered after 10 days of ordering it.the phone is quite ok considering its price.the scree is crisp ad clear,the touch screen sensor is great,a light touch will do the work,very sensitive.whe it comes to the camera,the rear camera gives a decent pictures,frot camera is disgusting.i am not yet sure if straight talk 45 dollar unlimitted data will work on this phone,i am still waiting for the sim card i order.' **** 'straight'
---"the phone also lacks an led notification light.the phone immediately recognized my straight talk sim card (i'm using straight talk on at&t;'s network).if you want to use straight talk for data, you will need to update the phone's apn settings." **** 'straight'
---'using this phone with straight talk at&t sim card, the service is not very good at all compared to other phones that i have used with this sim card.' **** 'straight'

Negative Reviews:

---"it arrived packed with great care the phone's box was wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap packing tape and cardboard even the phone's box seems like it could take a pounding in fact it did one corner had minor damage.prosbattery life: 9 hours 42 minutes to 10% battery power very heavy use lots of data screen on very bright.display is crisp with vivid colors great response time, very easy to see in bright light.system is blazingly fast, stable and strong.the phone is very well built seems like it can take some moderate abuse and shrug it off.camera is respectable but at the end of the day its a cell phone its unrealistic to expect the quality of picture from this as you would get from a $200 digital camera but at 8 megapixels is fine plus being able to take 34,000+ pics on a 32gb card is a bonus.ringtones and speaker are both great i'm very hard of hearing and have no issues hearing this phone." **** 'bubble'
