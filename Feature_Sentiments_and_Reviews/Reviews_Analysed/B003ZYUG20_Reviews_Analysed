Positive Reviews:

---"screen character size is also great for poor vision.setting up the phone isn't too bad, although the menu button is a little touchy going directly to phone book if you're not dead center on the button.inputting phone numbers is a little tedious - although being given the choice between saving to the phone or the sim card is nice.. a button for both would be even more handy.i have yet to set up the voicemail because the carrier (red pocket mobile) is awful on customer service and has not responded to my questions via email yet.. and their on line chat has never been available when i wanted to ask a question." **** 'awful'
