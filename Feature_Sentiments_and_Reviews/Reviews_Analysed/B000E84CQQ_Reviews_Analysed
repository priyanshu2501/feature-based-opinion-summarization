Negative Reviews:

Positive Reviews:

---"i have dropped it from my 2-ft high desk to the concrete floor once today and it got nothing damaged, not even a dent or mark.but there are couple of bad designs as well (or maybe i'm just too picky :-).1. no voice dialing function, which is the most needed function when make calls while driving;2. the camera is only 1.3 megapixle resolution, so it's fine when viewing your photo just on the phone screen, but when you put it onto your computer, it turns into unacceptable;3. it does record videos, but only for couple of seconds, which means this function basically is useless in daily life;4. the most bad design is the earphone." **** 'daily'
---"i have no problem with my t 809. battery life is long for normal use if i charge it monday i don't have to charge it again till friday, blue tooth works fine even in distance, mp3 works great , the navigation is as easy as can be well at least to me ." **** 'long'

---'there seem to be more mp3 ringtones available to me with this phone.' **** 'available'

Negative Reviews:

---'out of all the feature its manual lists, the only features i use are making/receiving calls, taking pictures, and listening to mp3.things i like:[camera]- the lens rotates, and it is pretty bright (f/2.8)- 1.3mp... certainly this is not a substitute for a digital camera, but it does a decent job considering its size- good white balance- you can set your own mp3 as a ringtone, and samsung provides the program that edits the music (you need to convert it to 3gp, move it to memory card from computer, then copy to phone, then set as ringtone)- you can buy a bigger size micro sd card and expand its memory- nice crisp color display- easy to slide, good appearancethings i do not like:- it does not have any "hanger" for a hand/neck strap (think how cool it would be if you can hang this on your neck and listen to mp3)- limited selection of the  original ringtones that come with the pnone- setting mp3 as a ringtone takes an annoyingly lot of steps and is not described in the manual- the buttons are a little bit too small (and i\'m a female)i don\'t use bluetooth, text messaging, t-moble web etc so i can\'t comment on that to summerize i like its slick design, camera, and mp3 capabilities.bottom line: get this phone if you are a new subscriber and is getting from amazon for so little money.' **** 'original'
---"the only thing i can complain about is not yet being able to make mp3's ringtones but i'm working on that ;-)." **** 'able'
---'all you have to do is press and hold down the "#" key and your phone is in silent mode, and you do the same to turn silent mode off.3) not being able to set mp3\'s as ringtones... all you have to do is change the file extension on your computer to .3gp instead of .mp3.' **** 'able'

---"granted, if all you want in a phone is the ability to make and receive calls, you shouldn't be forking out a lot of money in the first place, so my complaints about this phone are not related to actual phone use.first, it seems pretty typical that the included ringtones with samsung (t-mobile, at least) phones suck." **** 'typical'
---'out of all the feature its manual lists, the only features i use are making/receiving calls, taking pictures, and listening to mp3.things i like:[camera]- the lens rotates, and it is pretty bright (f/2.8)- 1.3mp... certainly this is not a substitute for a digital camera, but it does a decent job considering its size- good white balance- you can set your own mp3 as a ringtone, and samsung provides the program that edits the music (you need to convert it to 3gp, move it to memory card from computer, then copy to phone, then set as ringtone)- you can buy a bigger size micro sd card and expand its memory- nice crisp color display- easy to slide, good appearancethings i do not like:- it does not have any "hanger" for a hand/neck strap (think how cool it would be if you can hang this on your neck and listen to mp3)- limited selection of the  original ringtones that come with the pnone- setting mp3 as a ringtone takes an annoyingly lot of steps and is not described in the manual- the buttons are a little bit too small (and i\'m a female)i don\'t use bluetooth, text messaging, t-moble web etc so i can\'t comment on that to summerize i like its slick design, camera, and mp3 capabilities.bottom line: get this phone if you are a new subscriber and is getting from amazon for so little money.' **** 'original'
