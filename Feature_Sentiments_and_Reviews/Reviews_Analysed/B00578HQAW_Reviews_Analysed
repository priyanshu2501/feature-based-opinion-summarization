Negative Reviews:

---"however, having said that, it seems that if you allow all manner of back-ground programs to run (which is what will happen - unless you intervene), that you may spend some part of your day re-charging this device just to keep it alive.however, experience users (e.g., att reps who own this device, & other us citizens) advise me that selecting task managers (installed) or market-available task managers (free), will extend your battery's life well beyond default settings." **** 'other'
