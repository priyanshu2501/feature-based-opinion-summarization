__________('motorola',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"it does not matter if you are using 1 application, the processor doesn't seem to handle it and you will be spammed with error messages about unresponsive applications, when the fact is the hardware cannot even handle 1 single app when you touch more than 1 button in less than 1 second on the touch screen.my advice: motorola is doing all wrong, and you don't have to pay for their mistakes." **** 'wrong'
