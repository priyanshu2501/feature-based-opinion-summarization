__________('camera',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"well, it is in absolute numbers since it does not come with secondary camera, which i've never used in e71 and e72, however, the so is clearly more stable and runs faster, designed also to incorporate facebook and twiter among other social networks apps natively.also, the assisted gps computes your position faster than e72." **** 'secondary'
---"ok, it is not fron a casting as the e71 but that doesn't mean it has a weak built, it feels rock solid and less suceptible to be damaged since it weights less and then less energy is needed to be absorbed, thus less prone to be damaged.in general conclusion it's a great phone, with less features like the secondary camera, which i never use, but it costs less and it has improvements learned from the very unstable e72." **** 'secondary'
---'if you want email, light browsing, facebook, camera, music, text messaging, maps with gps, etc.' **** 'music'
---"well i try not to open it ever again cause i worry i won't able to insert it in next time.it's ok, not too pretty, the loud speaker was awesome, camera is average." **** 'average'
---'if you are looking for a cool looking phone, with good camera, and good reception, unlocked for the any network in the world, this is the phone for you.' **** 'good'
---"and the camera flash on the camera is so bad, makes every picture look faded.there has only been one firmware update since, which i hoped would address any of these issues but it didn'ti do like the gps, mp3 player on e63 was better, you could still switch songs even if the phone was locked, the volume rocker is so stiff and the picture viewer doesnt allow for zooming into pictures.and pro side, it has a lot features and the reason i got was so i could use 32gb sd in it, but this phone has been the reason for so many frustrations that i just wish i could go back to my e63." **** 'bad'
---'the phone has a pretty good camera, is great at recording video (it does 480p), and holds connections well at either 3g or 3.5g/hspa.' **** 'good'
---"pros: fast wireless conection and search, easy navigation of menus, free gps, good audio quality and 5mp camera, fm or internet radio, battery life is excellent.cons:  it hasn't secondary camera for video calls, microsd under battery." **** 'secondary'
---'it is nice that the camera has an led flash, so photos can be better captured in low light.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---'e5 took less than 10 secs, e72 more than 3 minutes.the keyboard, although similar in size and key distribution, is more comfortable, i guess it is due to an improved key shape and they are slighly wider, which is very noticeable when writing.the camera is 5mp, i guess is the same.' **** 'noticeable'
---'the major con is that the camera is awful.' **** 'awful'
---'looks good, but the camera is not clear.' **** 'clear'
---"the design however has several drawbacks - the 5mp camera isn't the best one out there, the central trackpad takes a while to get used to and still does not feel like the old e71 and e72s." **** 'best'
---'bought an used one from amazon and was as good as new, with no scratches, and everything that is in a new item, just cheaper.the phone is a upgrade from a nokia 5800 xpress music (always been a nokia fan).pros:almost perfectfast, good built quality, right size.wifi, 3g, gps, mapsflash light (at least handy for my garage)good call quality.good battery lifecons:poor camera when using with low light, but ok for emergencies.recommended apps:opera web browserskypesplashid (password and sensitive data manager app)' **** 'poor'

Positive Reviews:

---'i used to think having a data plan was necessary, but this phone really changed my mind and now my pocket is much heavier because of it.' **** 'necessary'
---'i have at&t; and never had a data plan, so everyone told me that i would get slammed with a minimum of a $15 limited data plan fee as soon as i put my chip in.' **** 'minimum'
---"this would not be an issue for someone with unlimited data, as you could configure the access point to be packet data on your plan.calendar: i was able to configure the e5 calendar app to use our google account, so that the phone automatically syncs calendar entries - those made from the e5 will update our google calendar account, and updates to our google calendar made from other sources (such as the web interface or my husband's phone) will update the calendar on the e5." **** 'unlimited'

Negative Reviews:

---'i did call and demanded that the data plan be removed.' **** 'call'
---"this phone was perfectly designed for those of us who reject the hysteria around iphones et al, need a phone for calls and texting only, and aren't looking for a new toy.overall, if you're trying to avoid data plans but want a smart phone for the buttons (for ease of texting) plus a few other perks, i'd say this phone is the way to go." **** 'new'

---'it has great contact management and makes calling on a phone a good feature instead of a downside like it is on the iphone.' **** 'good'
---'this would be a nice feature to have.e-mail: the e-mail app is very easy to use to view, compose, and send e-mails, and allows you to configure more than one e-mail account.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---"the flash light is really a nice feature that cell-phones don't have anymore and nokia dedicated the space key, the largest key key's to the phone which is awesome.i replaced the memory with 16 buttons to put lots of music on it, and up to 5 gigabit there is no problem." **** 'nice'
---'i am a very technical user, so i can usually fiddle with it enough to get a certain feature to work again after something caused the settings to go awry.' **** 'certain'
---"if, however, there was a different phone with a similar feature set (including keyboard style, offline gps, etc) that was more refined, eliminated some of the annoyances of the e5, and wasn't much more expensive, i would probably consider that option." **** 'similar'
