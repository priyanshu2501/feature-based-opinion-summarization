---"as a side-note, i noticed major stuttering when playing 720p and 1080p videos, but i suspect that this may be a software issue that can be resolved down the road.- there is no led indicator on the phone, so you need to go through the phones interface to check battery life and other miscellaneous notifications like having a new voice mail or missed call.- this phone gets pretty hot, even under moderate usage.final thoughtsif you are not a big gamer, this device is wonderful especially considering it's gigantic 4.3 inch display and vibrant colors." **** 'other'

---'unlike apple, samsung has allowed them to fiddle with software, and this out of date software is the unfortunate outcome-> poor battery life because of old software: the outdated software causes the fully charged phone to drain in 8 hours if you are running apps (i have 8 or so apps running: facebook, latitude, etc), battery dies in 2 hours of google maps gps navigation.->phone is bloated with verizon ware such as "verizon navigator" which you cannot remove-> skype front camera not available with out of date android softwareverizon has no eta for software release.' **** 'poor'

---'as far as using it as a hot-spot, i have connected my blueray, wii, xbox, and hdtv to it at the same time and they have all performed flawlessly as described by samsung.the only thing, and it is very minor imo, is that when the phone is on with a headset the screen sleeps after 30 seconds...there is a fix, which requires you to "touch" the screen, but that sort of defeats the purpose of hands-free communication...if anyone knows of a better workaround please post it so i can "fix" and "educate" myself better.overall i give the phone 5-stars, because for my experiences with blackberry storm 2 (waste of money at any price)and moto droid x (too slow), this phone rocks...obviously it will be slower than a phone with a dual-core processor, but i didn\'t have one so i can\'t comment on that.get this phone if upgrading from a single core processor and you with love it...if you already have dual core, move to the samsung nexus, as that phone is just awesome, even when compared to the greatness of the samsung droid charge.good luck!' **** 'single'

---'the camera is not very good but that is about the only complaint i have besides for the battery.' **** 'good'
---'unlike apple, samsung has allowed them to fiddle with software, and this out of date software is the unfortunate outcome-> poor battery life because of old software: the outdated software causes the fully charged phone to drain in 8 hours if you are running apps (i have 8 or so apps running: facebook, latitude, etc), battery dies in 2 hours of google maps gps navigation.->phone is bloated with verizon ware such as "verizon navigator" which you cannot remove-> skype front camera not available with out of date android softwareverizon has no eta for software release.' **** 'available'

---"it is the least flawed 4g lte phone that verizon currently has to offer.pros:* better than the htc thunderbolt and the lg with battery life* awesome super amoled plus display* almost no random reboots compared to the htc thunderbolt* microhdmi output works great* overall better than the other 4g lte phones currently available from verizoncons:* when 4g lte connection is lost it usually never comes back without restarting the phone (airplane mode toggle trick usually doesn't work) - improvements seen with leaked gingerbread 2.3.4* when data all together (4g,3g,1x) is lost it will never come back on its own, a restart is required - improvements seen with leaked gingerbread 2.3.4* sometimes the phone will stop charging when a notification is received such as an email or text message* using the flash on the camera immediately powers off the phone like a blackout without the shutdown process, just black screen completely off, a battery pull is required to turn it back on* sometimes you receive a 32gb class 2 microsd card, sometimes you receive a 32gb class 4 or 6 microsd card with it, luck of the draw i guess, poor quality control/marketing/packing/distribution/logistics i guess* bluetooth is buggy, samsung uses their own bluetooth stack implementation and it doesn't play nice with all bluetooth devices out there, but what bluetooth does, but theirs is the bully on the playgroundadditionally:some people speculate that the speed of the microsd card is why sometimes their phones shut off completely when attempting to take a picture." **** 'black'
