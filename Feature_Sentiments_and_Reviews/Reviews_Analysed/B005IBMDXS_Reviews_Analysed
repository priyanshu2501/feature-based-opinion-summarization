---'problem: the touch screen is so laggy and inaccurate a simple operation like this can take several attempts to get the right little icon selected (sometimes the entire "quick access" panel just disappears entirely from the screen and you have to go find it).' **** 'touch'
---'there is a similar model that is actually cheaper but has an actual flip out keyboard and a touch screen - i chose this phone, however, because it has a larger touch screen.one of the only apps i do miss is skype - this phone has no skype option.' **** 'touch'

---"i just purchased this phone from walmart and i must say, that im surprised at how well it functions..before i added a plan to it, i tried the wi-fi out and it worked fantastically..the youtube only works if your wi-fi connection is good and the quality of the videos might not be up to par with the other touch screens, it's still decent..im not a fan of the apps, but the ones that are available for the phone are limited if you go on the phone site, but there are other sites that you can go to in order to get more..i heard alot of ugly reveiws about the phone freezing and rebooting itself..as long as i had it, it hasn't froze once...im thinking i got one of there tweeked phones." **** 'other'

---'if you are not very careful, the screen will unlock during your phone call and a slight touch to your ear will generally terminate your phone call.texting:  the screen is terrible.' **** 'careful'
---'it is not compatible with the pandora mobile app unfortunately either... oh well...the only other reasonable complaint about this phone, which is blown out of proportion by some other reviewers, is problems with the touch screen... it is not the most intuitive touch screen by any means... it is difficult to get used to at first and not as easy as others off the bat, but as with any phone, it merely takes some getting used to and you eventually use it as fast as any other phone.' **** 'touch'
---"second, the screen is not nearly sensitive enough; it always thinks you're touching something you didn't want to touch." **** 'second'

---'it as a pretty good memory for pictures and other data but i use my  mp3 player along with a 16 gb sd card i brought separately , now i got about 2000 songs.the only pet peeve about that is i was never able to get my cover art.the camera is not the best and it has no flash but it takes pretty good picture if outside or in well lite area.' **** 'other'
---'if this phone had a slide out qwerty keyboard i might have given it 5 stars.phone is not for you if you are a heavy data user.' **** 'heavy'
