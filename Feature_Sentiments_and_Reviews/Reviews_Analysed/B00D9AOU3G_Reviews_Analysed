Positive Reviews:

---"even if you use the &#34;stop-gap&#34; fixes described in other reviews (uninstalling bloatware apps, disabling ones you can't uninstall like google magazines, clean cache on the regular, move all you can like photos & music to external memory, etc) you will still be constantly battling for space if you like using lots of apps, especially medium to large sized ones (eg over 10mb with ample cache usage).that said, this is a great phone to root." **** 'regular'
