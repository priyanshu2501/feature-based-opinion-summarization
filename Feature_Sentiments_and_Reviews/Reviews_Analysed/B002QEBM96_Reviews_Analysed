---"actually, i absolutely love the qwerty keyboard, it's easy on the fingers but it feels firm and well built at the same time.navigation improved quite a bit thanks to the tiny optical touchpad and you still have e71's directional keys if you prefer them.as i mentioned before, the processor is quite fast and the user interface is snappy and responsive, exactly what a business user needs." **** 'directional'

---'email on the nokia is also surprisingly good despite the bad reviews.' **** 'good'
---'i know of a few guys who buy iphones only to give it to their wife, who use the iphone for a while and then change to a more robust nokia phone.i find that nokia have a wide range of handset designs that are suited to a larger spectrum of users (teens, moms, young adults, professionals, seniors).however, some of the good phones seem to lack just "one thing" to attract full blown media blitz...not enough ram, or lower res camera or keypad size or screen size.nokia need to come up with a "cool and complete" phone every once in a while and commit more towards promoting that "cool and complete" model in the media.nokia seem to be content to let the sales volumes speak up for some of their popular models (eg n95, e71), but supporting the sales volume with some marketing campaign may help to capture back some of the mindshare and the media space.nokia\'s marketing certainly need to get their act together and put across a conherent message for each phone or range of phones.' **** 'robust'

Negative Reviews:

---"the e72 shows improvements on every department, great camera both for day and night shots, excellent gps even when the garmin mobile xt doesn't work on fp2 the nokia maps does a great job, comes with all the major email clients preinstalled, no more out of memory errors due to the increased phone memory, and a great processor speed upgrade.i had to look around for clients that used to be standard on my e71 that are not on the e72 (podcast clients,internet radio,im,etc) but if you cover that gap with 3rd party software this phone does it all.i have been on the road for the last month and had no need of using another device the e72 has been enough to cover all my needs including voip.i highly recommend this phone, and honestly i haven't found any problems or issues with it." **** 'enough'

---'hello its me john.thank you for my delivery of this nokia e72.i am delighted with this phone.nokia should not stop poiducing this model-its excellent-they just need to update it.i thought delivery took a long time and they should have made it more clear of the duty being paid .also on opening the package there were no instructions with the phone and if it were truly bran new it would have had an instruction book/leaflet.one more point although they made clear it was from the states they could have made a different plug with 3pin alternative knowing it was coming to the uk..otherwise a good phone by nokia.one last point.i am still getting it all working yet -takes time and may just find myself going to carphone warehouse to finnish the  contacts and putting them on to the mobile harddrive.thats all thank you.john.' **** 'long'
