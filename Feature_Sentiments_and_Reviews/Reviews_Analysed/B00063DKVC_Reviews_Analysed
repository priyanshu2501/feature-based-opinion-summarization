Positive Reviews:

---'when i got the phone back from their service facility untouched, all they can say is "i\'m sorry, i understand," but your only solution is to have bought insurance in the first 7-14 days or else its too late and you will have to buy another device full price.' **** 'late'

---"while it is true that the data was down for a couple of days last week, it was because danger (the manufacturer of the device that also runs the servers that the sidekick uses to connect to the internet) was updating their servers.the camera, while nothing special, is a nice feature for taking those pictures that you'd never get a chance to take." **** 'last'

__________('mail',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i can be on aim talking to 10, checking my mail, while talking on other messenger services.' **** 'checking'
---"***this phone reminds me of the palm os; it seems to work well and has no lock up issues that i've seen.it is painless to figure out, and that may be the best selling point.i have a top of the line pda, and i was looking for something that was 60% phone and 40& pda, and this seems to be it.tho i don't think it would be good for business.there is no additional storage space- and you don't have the email customization that black berry has.here in san diego the reception is excellent.email: the tmail worked right away and  ability to snap a photo, click send, and up comes the photo in the mail and ready to go.i am coming from a hitachi pocket pc and i have had issues with that, one being that it would reset itself and the usual need to occasionally reset." **** 'ready'

Negative Reviews:

---'minimal use, every other night.sync: you cannot sync to computer, but you can use the online date book/calendar sync, so it is doable.mail & messaging: comes with your own tmail account, and it signals when new mail comes in.i have aol mail & im on there; you can have most everything, but not corporate- at least not as well as black berry.i do like this feature: you can set it to (example) normal ring at 9am and then silent at 10pm.' **** 'new'
---"email was fine, but it did bother me that often i couldn't see my aol mail which was my major mail account because the sk doesn't support html codes.camera:subpar but it's there." **** 'major'
