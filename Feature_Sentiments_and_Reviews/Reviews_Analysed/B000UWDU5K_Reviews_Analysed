__________('buttons',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"These phones live in a leather case, and are not abused (I use a wired headset).- It's a big heavy phone.- Intellitext (or whatever they call it) when typing text messages is simply annoying - not helpful- Picture quality for a 3 Mega Pixel camera is very poor- Buttons are only partially customizable without add-in programsIs there anything that I like about these phones?" **** 'poor-'
---'It really needs larger on-screen buttons, more sensitivity to touch like the iPhone, and the screen needs to light up when touched.' **** 'larger'
---'However, the touch screen buttons are always too small to use your fingers.' **** 'small'

Negative Reviews:

---'5) The change to the buttons are a step backwards in my opinion for two reasons: a) they moved the e-mail and IE buttons down so that everything is crowded in one clump of buttons now making the buttons more difficult to press for the average size or larger finger/thumb, and b) the chrome finish is cheesy looking and just shows fingerprint smudges.' **** 'difficult'
---'The internet and email buttons are now down at the bottom with all the other buttons.' **** 'other'
---'But several differences are worth pointing out:- In making it a slicker looking phone the 8925 lost all the wonderful side buttons on the 8525, and some of those retained are so flat against the side that they are hard to press - the phone start/stop buttons are smaller and much harder to read and locate.' **** 'smaller'
---"The wonderful buttons at the top of the 8525 are removed, probably because when you pulled the phone out of your pocketone would frequently find you'd been on the internet draining your battey." **** 'top'

__________('calls',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'Calls are clear and the data ability on the device is awesome.' **** 'clear'
---'Really annoying when you\'re driving and talking on you hands free and it just goes dead.- when you make a call, the power goes off on the phone - while some at the AT&T; store claim this as a power saving "feature" it\'s really annoying for those who want to retrieve voicemail or do any kind of keying after the call has been made- voicemail & text mail notifications are flaky - many times you get a vmail and never get a notification.- dropped calls - really bad.' **** 'bad'

Negative Reviews:

---"(Shame on you, AT&T; - for what you charge for your service, there's absolutely no excuse for dropping calls due to what appears to be lack of proper cell hand-off, or what-ever gremlins you couldn't work out of your hodgepodge of a network!!!)" **** 'due'
