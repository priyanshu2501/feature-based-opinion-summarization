Positive Reviews:

---'everything on this phone is slower than it should be due to the fact that htc chose not to include hardware graphics acceleration (something that is present on all other smartphones).' **** 'present'
---'hopefully someone will do something similar for the 8925. reprograming the push to talk button on the 8525 gave me the critical buttons i wanted:  email / internet / camera / voice speed dial/ and data connection.' **** 'similar'
---"otherwise the internet seems to work great, 3g and hspda are a hell of a lot better than the standard edge i used on the 8125, or what people w/ the iphone have to deal with.one of the main reasons i got this phone was i wanted it to be my portable computer, something that would be able to play music, movies, tv shows and keep me connected while i'm on the go." **** 'able'

Negative Reviews:

---'i have used the camera a couple of times and the pictures are terrible (unless i am doing something really wrong with the camera feature), the camera feature is useless.6.' **** 'wrong'

---"there's something similar to windows explorer to get around to your files, you've basically got microsoft word, power point and excel available to you and you basically just open and close windows when using the phone.this is not a phone you will be using your fingers with a lot." **** 'similar'
---'first of all it is about twice the weight of the 8125, and finished in a slippery gloss black sheen that makes it all but impossible to get it out of the separately purchased holster without dropping it (took 2 months to find one that fit the odd size of this phone); the power button and the "push to talk" button (more on this annoying feature later) all but guarantee when your slipping and sliding to get it out of the holster you\'ll hit one of them and mess something up or hang up on your caller.' **** 'hang'

Negative Reviews:

Positive Reviews:

---')before i begin, let me say that i agree with everything ms. sminkey says in her review of the at&t; tilt smartphone, and she\'s done a lot more with it that i have, at this point, but i have three bits of advice that anyone who buys this phone needs to know:1)  if one of the main reasons you use a "smartphone" for is to make your life easier by keeping your contact information there in the palm of your hands, then you need to know that to synchronize your data between outlook (i use outlook 2007) and your at&t; tilt) you need to do the following.' **** 'easier'
---"also voice dialling isn't accessible without going through the start menu so useless when driving unless you reassign it to a front-panel function key (i sacrificed the web browser key for the audio-recognizer).from time to time, as is characteristic of windows, it just freezes for a few seconds, very frustrating when wanting to make a call.battery life is a little unpredictable." **** 'unpredictable'
---'therefore, because of my experiences thus far i would rate the battery life as fair when compared to some other smart phones.' **** 'fair'

Negative Reviews:

---"i would like stereo speakers and better bluetooth quality, but some of the tweaks i used helped the bluetooth.the phone runs a little better after you spend 20-30 hours on the internet researching it and tweaking it, but there is really no excuse for not having the 3d drivers.the gps works good, however the gps software (i've tried four different programs) has trouble rendering the screen and is choppy and sluggish due to the missing drivers.the camera is all but unusable due to the missing drivers, it has alot of trouble rendering the target and takes along time to process the picture due to having to do everything through software and having no hardware graphical support." **** 'better'
