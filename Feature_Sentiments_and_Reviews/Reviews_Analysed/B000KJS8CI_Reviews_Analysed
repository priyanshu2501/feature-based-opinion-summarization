Positive Reviews:

---'(takes some tweaking and, yes, this feature is a big deal)-comes with extra battery that can be charged without being inside the phonecons-no wi-fi-battery drains quickly (still better than the motorola q from what i hear, but should be charged daily just to be safe)-no 8mm headphone jack (why do cellphone companies keep doing this!?)' **** 'better'
