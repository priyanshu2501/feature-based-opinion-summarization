Positive Reviews:

---'that is bad because, after you hit send, the phone will sometimes fail to send it immediately (as in you need to wait like 5-10 seconds and not press a button that may cancel sending the text) or it may not send at all.'
---'my son has bought this exact phone a few times and liked it so when i needed a new phone with bluetooth i bought this one.'
---'needless to day, the result was the same, and he confidently announced that he would transfer 140 minutes to my new phone.'
---'i set mine to "never" for the time being, but there\'s a danger of the phone "pocket dialing" (dialing a phone number because of pressure on it while it\'s in your pocket or its case) so you may want to choose 10, 20, 30, or 60 seconds.this leads to the second thing i want to say here - almost any question you might have about the phone can be answered by a google search - so use that liberally, if you need to.'
---'old this deal was sweet but she\'s ready to pass the phone down already it comes woth too games and a few different wallpapers do not use the cartoon theme it makes the phone look super cheap & ugly even my daughter hates it she wants to pass it along to her younger sibling because she tends to get bored with it compared to the vast majority of app\'s i have on my phone other then that "yes she\'s spoiled" it\'s a great phone for some one who infrequently uses there phone & who doesn\'t need multiple app\'s & web that\'s super fast i say go for it the price is exceptionally great even though i got a refurbished one for 5.00$ yep that\'s right 5.00$ i got a bang for the buck also a great back up phone thanx for reading hope this helps o'

---"i don't need any other phone for me"
---'this is the best phone for its price; great for anyone who needs to talk alot with a little texting on the side.'
---"if you need a good phone that isn't overly expensive or hard to figure out, than i would definitely recommend this company and phone to you!"
---'this lg800g phone is the second for me - one to carry, one for the car to make sure i am covered if needed.'
---"don't like the lock button coming on every time you need to do something but it's a nice little phone."
---'this phone is so small i thought it would be bigger then this i was disappointed and mad everyone i showed it to said to me why did i buy this phone i told them it was for emergencies when i needed to make a call i would not recommend this phone to any one'
---'when on my account summary page, i was told that my phone number needed to be verified, and to enter it below...but the page provided no place for me to enter my number.after spending 30 minutes on the phone with customer service, they were still unable to add minutes to my account.i have decided to throw out my tracfone and instead buy a gophone from at&t.'
---"i highly recommend this phone, but make sure you buy the extra's as it only comes with a/c plug in, so you will need a car plug in and screen protectors etc."
---'the phone is very nice, however there is a learning curve that i need to refer to the book very often'
---'people hear me say when i\'m using this phone "i hate this phone" then they try it and say "yep it is to much work, you need a new phone" the only thing good about it is the triple minutes.don"t buy it.'
---'if i want to be re-enrolled in our family plan i need to call back at the end of october, but before the new minutes are charged for november and then they "should be able to re-enroll my phone in the value plan"" should!!!!'
---'i was actually told that i should have informed the customer service rep that i will need to reenroll my phone in the same plan it was already enrolled in, when they swapped over to the new phone.'
---'it is annoying and also dangerous, i need a phone that works in case of emergency, not some undependable piece of plastic.'
---'this is a good phone and does everything we need it to do.'

Negative Reviews:

---"this phone arrived on time and is one of the best i've ever owned, it does everything i wanted and more, not needing or wanting a data plan, i couldn't have found a better phone for any amount of money and the service is the best!"
---"i think i need to go back to a full keyboard phone like the samsung.more than likely, i'll sell this phone to someone else, or give it to a friend if they want it, and then i'll get the samsung unit and transfer my number/minutes, etc to that phone.the instruction manual for this phone is also a joke."
---'if i need another new phone, this will be the one!'
---"she didn't understand why i am tired of getting bumped off  automated phone lines because i run out of time after pressing the lock button, then the dial pad button, then the dial code, if i can remember the option by then.so, a plain old phone seems pretty good right now.and, someone needs to tell india about american names like betty sue and bobbie jo, or tamreka or aretha...that would be fun."
---'its a great little phone and is meeting our needs.'
---"if you are an infrequent user and don't need to be a trend-copier but still want a dependable, durable, economical yet multi-functional phone with _some_ options, this trac-fone model is for you."
---'whether you are looking for a temp phone or a prepaid plan on a regular basis and you want or need a stylish phone you cannot go wrong with this purchase.'
---'good cheap little phone, touch screen needs harder touch than usual touch screen...  sucks up minutes if you get on web, good to use just for inexpensive phone'
---'pay-as-you-go services also tend to reduce communication costs because you use the minutes (and therefor the costs) as you need.the lg 800 g is a great little phone with talk, text, web, camera, video, voice recorder, to do list and calender.'
---'i am not looking to complicate my life with all kinds of  &#34;must have&#34;,  i just want a good phone and this is it, if you need a good phone, buy it , it has the good functions but if you need a phone to fill your ego and waste your time learning how to use it, buy another phone.'

---'so if you\'re not tech savy or don\'t care to fall into the trap of "i need the newest, greatest phone every year", then this is the phone.'
---"i don't need to talk on this phone that much so it is perfect for me and no long term contract.one other thing i would like to mention is this phone can do email and go online."
---"don't like the lock button coming on every time you need to do something but it's a nice little phone."
---'not the smartest phone out there, light years behind a droid or iphone, but meets my needs.'
---"i like being able to just pay for the phone time that i need rather than paying for a plan that i don't use."
---"it's not the best phone ever, but it works for what a phone is needed for.the only things i don't like about this phone is:-when you get a message, you don't know who it's from until you've opened it, it just says 'new message'.-every-so-often, it locks me out of it... i go to open my phone to check n' see if i have any messages, and it automatically locks me out and i have to put the puk code in :/."
---"i highly recommend this phone, but make sure you buy the extra's as it only comes with a/c plug in, so you will need a car plug in and screen protectors etc."
---"as i needed a smart phone to run the apps for a nissan leaf, i thought this was a huge deal; caviet emptor(latin:let the buyer beware)!while it is a touch screen phone, the operating system is proprietary.this means it won't run apps for android, lion, or iphone operating systems which comprise most of the app market.however, as a basic function phone, it's great.crisp, clear voice transmissions.just need a stylish phone, this is it!if you need to run apps and link to different networks, due diligence pays."
---'my bf has an unlimited phone he uses for business if i need to make a long phone call but this is just right for me.'
---"i don't use my phone for internet anyway for 22 $ it's a very good phone the keypad & board are large reception is good mp3 w headphones sounds very good camera is good battery life is good screen is large enough i would buy it again if needed .i paid 28 $ in dec 2012 ."
---"you don't want to set it loud all the time, but sometimes there's a need for that.i left a message on my home voicemail system from this new phone."
