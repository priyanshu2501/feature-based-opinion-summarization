---"I bought this phone from Tracfone site and in my opinion it would be a great starter phone for a child  and elder adult who is upgrading from a standard flip phone I bought this phone because my 5 yr. Old couldn't keep her hands off of my net10 android phone & I am a person who can't live without a cellular phone that's unlimited (tracfone does not offer unlimited plans) I have 3 very small children in which 2 of them have had serious illnesses.... Well to begin this LG 800G is not powered by android so no it does not have Google playstore it does have app's that my daughter doesn't use so I'm unfamiliar with that part, It is very small, One of the things I hate is the screen is kind of difficult when responding to your touch sometimes it bounces every where like it's crazy and you have to go back using the back/reverse arrow how ever I do like the fact I can send my daughter music ringtones (Which cost alot of minutes) how ever they do sound pretty good I also sent her wallpaper that looks great on her phone (ex.. Minnie Mouse) that I downloaded to my phone first the video Is pretty standard so are the pictures the voice is pretty good better then my android phone the phone stays charged for a nice amount of time activation was simple for the first phone but it was very difficult for the second activation I i bought 2 of them one for my mother and one for my daughter, I like the fact the minutes do triple and for a 5yr." **** 'kind'
