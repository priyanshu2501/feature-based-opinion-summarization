Negative Reviews:

---'in fact, since my moto had gotten so bad, i popped my sim card into an older nokia i have (3 yrs) and it worked like a charm.pros of the phone include:-generous outside display - bigger than any other phones i have seen, but the megapixels are not as good as the inside screen, but can\'t win them all and it definitely works well-sleek, black outside, so refreshing that it is not standard cell phone silver which is way too played out.-menus are easy to navigate, but i fing a 2 second delay when pulling up the main menu, but definitely something i can live with.-camera is very good, considering this is not a phone you would buy specifically for the camera.-construction is sturdy - those who said that nokia flips have a "cheap" feel are way off - this one is substantial, dense, but not too big or too heavy.the only cons are that i sometimes the earpiece volume is not that great.' **** 'bigger'
