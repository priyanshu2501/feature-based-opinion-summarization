---'"seconds" doesn\'t usually indicate a long time, but compare it to any smartphone released in the past year and it\'ll seem slow.once initial setup was completed, a walkthrough began to play which demonstrated how to use the phone\'s gestures.' **** 'long'
---"text is easy to read and colors are vibrant.-keys on the keyboard are very easy to use, and are spaced relatively far apart.-excellent 3g signal strength (verizon network).-phone is very easy to navigate around, and changing from one app to another is very simple.-handles multi-tasking very well.-plenty of internal memory.-camera is average, takes fairly decent pictures.-very lightweight and virtually unnoticeable in pocket.-internet browser is very fast, and loads virtually every page correctly.-effortless set-up of e-mail accounts; e-mail platform is very reliable.-phone has fast software and everything opens and loads very quickly.-very responsive.-gesture area is very convenient and works with no problems.-convenient vibrate only switch-comes with very useful software such as a pdf viewer and document viewer which allows opening of microsoft word attachments from e-mail's.cons:-smaller screen than an iphone (not really a big deal as clarity is impeccable).-takes a long time to power on and re-start.-no sd card slot.-no auto correct while text messaging-app catalogue is somewhat lacking when compared to apple or android.-battery cover is hard to remove.overall i highly recommend this phone." **** 'long'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"there is supposed to be a single switch on the outside of the case to be used to silence the ringer without going through menu's, but on my phone it seems to get temperamental sometimes, switching between the two modes unless we really set the switch to either side in an assertive way.the software and interface take a little bit of getting used to but after a few days it feels really nice, intuitive and easy to use." **** 'nice'

__________('connected', 'to', 'wifi')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"you just have to make sure to turn wifi off when it's not in range because it expends a lot of battery power to search for available wifi.e-mail sets up easily and if you are connected to 3g or to wifi it pops up in the bottom part of your phone, you can click on it or slide it off and not see the notification.the gestures on the phone make it very easy to use." **** 'sure'

Negative Reviews:

---'of course with verizon, a data plan is required and they only offered one plan on my family plan, so it costs an extra $29.99 for me for unlimited data.this also comes with a mobile hotspot that you can connect up to 5 devices with, but i thought verizon charged an extra $40 to activate the hotspot on top of your $30 data plan, plus it only goes up to 5 gb, and it counts all the data usage from any device connected to it.' **** 'top'
---'but, after speaking to the verizon rep, for this phone only, the 3g mobile hotspot is free up to 5gb.' **** 'free'
