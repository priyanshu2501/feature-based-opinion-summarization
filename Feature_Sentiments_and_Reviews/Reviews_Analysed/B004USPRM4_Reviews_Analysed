---"amazon/fgs messed up in my case and the device got stuck at customs with extra brokering fee charges, not very professional from a company used to shipping goods (i suppose it's the bulk of customers for this article since it's cheaper from other well-known dealers inside the us).this is a rather good smartphone, on the plus side:- the availability of android 2.3 though this is a temporary advantage, you can manually upgrade to 2.3.3 (as of time of writing), for some reason amazon's partner is still sending an old 2.3.1 version and there is no upgrade available from the usual settings menu;- the battery, which can easily last one or two days depending on the use of course;- very good display;- the basic initial set-up, not cluttered with applications, you get to choose what you really need;- unlocked (android), comes with a t-mobile sim that you are free to ignore.on the minus side,- why on earth isn't there a notification led?" **** 'good'
---"when i fell on it, and the screen cracked, and i was glad... that just about sums up my one year experience with the phone.it has just a few small flaws, but i hit them every day:1) the four touch buttons on the bottom get hit inadvertently, especially if you're playing a game or watching a movie.2) the four touch buttons are just about invisible in daylight.3) the much-vaunted oled display is just kinda sorta able to keep up with daylight.4) but... at night in a dark room putting the kids to bed... the lowest display setting is painfully bright.5) the speakerphone is muddy.6) reception (at&t; in solid 3g areas) pales compared to a years old feature phone on the same sim card in the same area.hey, great phone, but a few things i use every day just made it unpleasant." **** 'lowest'

Negative Reviews:

---"this thing is fast and reliable - i've only had it lock up 4 times, twice where i had to remove the battery, but that was only after leaving it on for 230 hours...:-/ lolvery bright flash - makes a wonderful flashlight.and the list goes on...really, there's very few cons, and certainly not any that can't be lived with - especially when you root your phone." **** 'reliable'
---'an interesting thing to note: the 16gb is partitioned similar to a phone with sd card, so you have about 2gb of "root" space- where the apps and actual android os stay, and then the 14gb "sd" partition that will be unmounted when you connect your phone to a computer (if that didn\'t make sense to you, don\'t worry).' **** 'interesting'
---"it also has no search function for the android stock email app unless you're on gmail (yes, really), and the earpiece volume can't be set low enough - minimum setting is what i would call dangerously loud, keep this thing away from your kids if you want them to be able to hear later in life." **** 'loud'
