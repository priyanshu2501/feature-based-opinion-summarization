Positive Reviews:

---'If you are reading this, and deciding between the original Hydro and he Hydro Edge, my advice is to save your money and go with the old Hydro, or wait, and maybe a 3rd Hydro will surface and fix the mistakes/lack of improvement.' **** 'original'
---"Having owned the original Hydro for just about a year, I've watched and waited to see how the rest of the industry would react to Kyocera's wild-card entre&eacute; into the smartphone field." **** 'original'
---"I didn't have to wait long: the Hydro EDGE isn't a refresh of the original Hydro so much as it is a total rethinking: if you regard the original Hydro as something of a proof-of-concept first-offering (and not a shabby one, I'd add), the EDGE is a confident redesign that rises above middle-of-the-road status with serious el&aacute; n. Improvements?" **** 'long'
---'One interesting change - an improvement, in my book - is the battery cover on the back, which in the case of both old and new Hydro is a crucial part of the phones\' "waterproofiness": the original model had a hard-plastic cover which, once removed, exposed nearly the entire back of the phone, and whose relatively-fragile silicone sealing "band" hugged the very edge.' **** 'new'
---'The one time I pulled the cover off was to install the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro-SD card from my original Hydro.' **** 'original'
---'Other Small but Important changes: the flip-off cover protecting the micro-USB charging port on the original Hydro is gone from the EDGE: presumably, Kyocera figured out how to make the port water-friendly without the need for such a prophylactic.' **** 'original'
---'I had the original Hydro for the same reasons everyone else did - sorta water proof but a price tag (even brand new at $129) that you could handle replacing if you ruined it.' **** 'original'

---"Not that you'll be doing much of that: While I have had to do the odd battery-pull to do a hard-reset on the original Hydro (though nowhere nearly as much as I've suffered with other phones in my past), I've yet to yank the cover from the Edge in the two months I've used it, loaded with apps and used quite heavily." **** 'odd'
