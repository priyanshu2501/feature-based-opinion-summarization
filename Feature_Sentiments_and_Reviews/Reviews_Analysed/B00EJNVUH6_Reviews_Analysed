---"battery life has also been improved, with kyocera claiming upwards of 13 hours talk time and 180 hours standby time.and they wrapped it up in what i consider a quite attractive package: about the same width as the original hydro, a bit taller (to accommodate the half-inch-larger screen), but roughly two-thirds the thickness, the edge subjectively exudes a solidity in the hand that the original, good as it is, doesn't quite pull off." **** 'original'

Positive Reviews:

---"i decided i'd just have to wait until kyocera decided to do a refresh of the hydro.i didn't have to wait long: the hydro edge isn't a refresh of the original hydro so much as it is a total rethinking: if you regard the original hydro as something of a proof-of-concept first-offering (and not a shabby one, i'd add), the edge is a confident redesign that rises above middle-of-the-road status with serious el&aacute;n.improvements?" **** 'refresh'
