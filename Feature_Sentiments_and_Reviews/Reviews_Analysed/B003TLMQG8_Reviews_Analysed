Negative Reviews:

---'after doing a rather extensive research i got this phone, yes i evaluated it over iphones, other androids, my own windows phone etc.first i\'m gonna start with the con\'s that i see... cause they are so little :dto short battery life ( but you can have several batteries, car charger wall charger, charge it on the pc and what not )the camera sometimes lags a bit, but just a tad.. and normally i take video in low light, i have to test it a bit more.pros:no idea where to start, this thing is called a "phone" but it\'s basically another pc, i have not tested the bluetooth so i can\'t talk about it but here\'s my review on other things ( i come from a windows mobile phone , the tytn ii )the screen is just exquisit, it looks vivid, bright, clean and inviting, it does not hurt you to use it for hours and hours, i wish my pc monitor and tv monitor where samoled, i really have to say that since i got this phone i have used it ( amongst many other things ) as a book reader, without any strain, actually i have read 2.5 books so far, and i really love it, i use the adobe pdf viewer from the market or the quickoffice pdf viewer.the 3g that it has is super fast, much better than on my other phone, it connects in seconds and well also the wifi, but i love how it automatically switches from wifi to 3g depending on the fact that it finds the wifi network or not, normally i\'m not even aware what network it\'s using unless the 3g lags but that\'s not the phone that\'s the 3g.the sensitivity of the screen is so so good, that even my almost 2yo daughter uses this phone, she uses simple games like mole,mole,mole, or talking tom ( all from the marketplace ) so really you don\'t have to be a genius to use this, heck also my mom that is 60+++ has used it, and she loves it, specially the fact that because the screen is so large that she can actually see it.oh the volume is great, and the reception is awesome as well, the speaker-phone feature is extremely good ( sometimes you would wish for a bit more volume, but still it\'s extremely good )the camera, i love the camera, but i love even more that i can take a video and just send it right to youtube, ( in hd and all ), so i don\'t even need my pc to upload the videos to it then to youtube, direct upload is awesome.also i love the widget it has for social medial, i can wake up and check up facebook, twitter and myspace, even comment and reply, ( even post if i wakeup in the middle of the night ) on that widget i also have the weather forecast, and ap news, so basically i can do "basic" chores while still in bed, get informed, check the twits, and see if it\'s gonna be rainy :doh the youtube app it has is awesome, and once again it\'s used a lot by my daughter, she loves to see kids clips there, so she really likes that, and i don\'t have to go to the pc to put her videos.oh also i have a htpc, ( home theater pc ) that\'s windows 7 using the windows media center, that i control with a physical remote, but now i also control it from the phone ( over wifi, not ir )it\'s so light, that i really can use it basically all day, oh and i use it for instant messaging as well..the other viewers it has are awesome, specially skyfire, where you can watch justin.tv ( yesterday i saw toystory again ), and i would love this phone to have netflix support that\'s the only thing i\'m missing really.of course it can be used as a video player since it has tv out, not hdtv but tv out, rca out, ( yellow, white, red ), oh and the allshare dnla server, great either watch the videos of the htpc or the pc on the phone or send the videos to the xbox360 or to the tv, or pc.also due to the huge amount of games this has, i have not used my psp as much lately, but i\'ve been playing a lot on this, most games are quite good and since they use screen  controls or tilting as controls they are different, my wife that is not a gamer at all, has been playing this game called angry birds that is quite addictive and fun.' **** 'good'

Positive Reviews:

---'returned to amazon and got working phone in two days, easy.' **** 'easy'
---'it gave me a tantalizing view of what mobile phones ought to look like in the distant future, but the present is just too primitive.first, the worst:  a few days ago i looked down at the phone and saw the screen faded almost to black, and the touchpad not working.' **** 'worst'
---"for neg's, i would say the speaker phone could be a tad louder, flash for night time shots would be great and wish i could get a solid 3 days of use, otherwise i keep a charger in the car just incase." **** 'solid'
---"email issue is no huge deal for me, because i can get by with just the gmail app, and this phone almost being obsolete is just the nature of the beast these days - having dual cores would be nice - it would probably make everything a little faster, but its not a deal breaker - this phone is more than capable and had the fastest cpu on the market the day it was released.this is the 3rd samsung phone i've owned - the a310, the agh 737, and now this." **** 'beast'

Negative Reviews:

---"at first it died pretty fast now i get 2 days from one charge....this is the best free phone i've ever seen or used bar none, but it's like att punishes me for getting a phone for 1 cent....sorry no 2-3g switch, and enjoy att where, what and why???" **** 'first'
---'(still not drawn to the iphone...)it was with much anticipation the captivate arrived, and i have spent a lot of time in the last few days checking it out.' **** 'last'
