---"if you are a heavy phone user watching lots of videos or play a lot of games you might want to pick up an extra battery for the phone, unlike the iphone it's easy to plop another one in on the nexus.things that impressed me the most -- upon plugging the phone in via usb to the pc you instantly have access to copy/paste files to the ringtones folder, photos, wallpaper, etc.... this was always a nightmare on the iphone for me since the fruit company locks everything down and makes it annoying to do anything without that bloated itunes program and 3rd party apps, custom iphone ringtones were always a pain because you had to convert them to a special file format first and were limited on ringtone file size." **** 'extra'
---"if you could ignore the 4g absence, no microsd expanison, and mediocre battery, then i recommend it.if you're considering this or the nexus 4, the only major differences are that the nexus 4 has a glass back, it has no removable battery, but it has wireless charging capabilities (have to buy an additional $60 charger), and it does not have a curved display, but it has gorilla glass." **** 'removable'
---"it will not last you an entire day if you are a heavy user.if you don't mind uglifying the phone with an extended battery with cover then this will probably be a mute point for you.2) even though the screen looks glorious, it is not as bright as that of the sgsii." **** 'extended'

---"the galaxy nexus is the one to be beaten!perfect touchscreen, perfect camera, perfect design, gorgeous photos and movies, huge and clear display, great music player, nfc ready, nice battery life...i also owned a galaxy sii before this one and although it had perfect hardware too, the gingerbread os and samsung touchwiz made it look still unfinished.that's not the case with the galaxy nexus and its pure google experience with android 4.0.haven't seen one flaw yet!" **** 'nice'

---"don't really have the time or desire to go comb through the thousands of available apps out there, so i think that 16gb of storage this device comes with will be more than sufficient.i was not happy with the battery life, until i downloaded the free easy battery saver, which has at least doubled my battery life...it does so by disconnecting the internet whenever in sleep mode, so you have to tolerate a 5-10 second reconnect time every time you wake it up." **** 'easy'

---'** update 2 **dropped the phone last week and the screen cracked.samsung won\'t do any repair for it in the us telling me to send it to canada.the guy said they only repair verizon phones and gsm phone bought directly from google play store.called the canadian office and was told replacing the screen will cost anywhere from $100-$300 (they won\'t give any estimate)i will also have to pay for shipping and insurance *both* ways which will bring the grand total to anywhere from $150 to $350.i strongly advice against buying the phone from this retailer and going directly to goggle play store where you will be able to get the phone serviced in the us.taking one star off for the lack of service.this is not a standard nexus phone and won\'t be updated by google.it is running samsung modified os "with really small region-specific tweaks".that means phone is not being updated by google (mine is locked to 4.0.1 and refuses to upgrade to 4.0.2/3)the whole idea of getting a google phone was to be able to get latest os version as soon as google makes them.my phone has os version yakjuxw (signed by samsung) instead of the standard yakju version of the gsm galaxy nexus.' **** 'google'

---"when using the navigator on and batteries at full charge, the battery will last maybe 2-3 hours.-android version 4.2.1 (it said jelly bean in ads and people's reviews, so i expect one, but personally i don't care).personally i do not like google nexus after using it (and google nexus 4 didn't help either), but overall, personal feelings aside, i can kinda, sort of ... recommend this phone for basic usage only, but not for a business class usage." **** 'google'

---"i have bought a google nexus  and i can't make any upgrade for the android version to 4.1so when can i upgrade my cellphone?" **** 'google'
---"google has been made aware of this on their support forums since the galaxy nexus released last year and has so far remained silent about a resolution which appears to be software-tweakable but primarily hardware-driven.and with the volume being mentioned, i have to also give a word on the quality of the music from google's music app on the phone itself." **** 'aware'
---'in the box was also a headset (earbuds w mic, actually comfortable compared to my old iphone earbuds), and the wall charger that doubles as a usb data charger/connection to your computer since the data cord snaps into the small wall plug, convenient!important note -- if you buy your nexus from anywhere other than the google play store, such as the phone in this listing, there is a good chance that it is not factory unlocked and that the 3rd party seller opened the box and unlocked the phone themselves.' **** 'other'
---'i would still recommend the galaxy nexus over the nexus 4.edit 1: included mentions about the new google edition devices- at google i/o 2013, and at the d11 conference, google introduced "their take on android", on the samsung galaxy s4 and the htc one.' **** 'new'
---'until this issue is solved in the next android os update (either android 4.3 jelly bean or android 5.0 key lime pie), this remains a slight issue.edit 3 (8/2/2013): google has recently announced android 4.3, the latest operating system, and it is indeed compatible with galaxy nexus, and it runs perfectly.' **** 'compatible'

---"don't really have the time or desire to go comb through the thousands of available apps out there, so i think that 16gb of storage this device comes with will be more than sufficient.i was not happy with the battery life, until i downloaded the free easy battery saver, which has at least doubled my battery life...it does so by disconnecting the internet whenever in sleep mode, so you have to tolerate a 5-10 second reconnect time every time you wake it up." **** 'available'
