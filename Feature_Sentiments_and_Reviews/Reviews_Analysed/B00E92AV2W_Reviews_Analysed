---"over the last 2 years, i have used a galaxy s3, galaxy nexus and galaxy note ii.but over the years, i realized that, for practical purposes, i don't need the latest-and-greatest in tech.i don't need a quad-core processor, or a 5.5 inches screen with stylus to just edit a few documents or watch youtube or listen to  pandora.and i certainly don't need any of that for regular texting and calling.so after researching the mid-range market, i finalized moto x.pros:+ perfect screen size (4.7', neither too small nor too big)+ pure google android with no bloatware from oems+ performance is very slick, unlike s3 or note ii+ decent battery life (i get through the day with moderate use)+ touchless features do make life slightly more convenient (especially where it automatically shows time if taken out of pocket)cons:- battery not removable- no sd card slot- in spite of 10 mp, camera performance not great- won't do my laundryand one last tip that is relatively hidden from the mainstream market -i broke my contract with sprint where i was paying $70 for unlimited everything (after employee discount) per month.i went prepaid with republic wireless that charges $10 for unlimited talk and text.i realized i am not using data that often so i am saving $60 per month (!)." **** 'moderate'
