Negative Reviews:

---'you have to slide the keyboard out slowly or it hangs.very disappointed in this vendor and will not believe their rating system anymore, i paid &#34;extra&#34; to get a phone &#34;based on their rating system of good&#34;... same phone listed in &#34;fair&#34; condition was cheaper.i suspect they only had a limited quantity of phones and sent this one even though it did not meet the &#34;guidlines&#34; for good.will not be buying from this vendor every again.' **** 'fair'
