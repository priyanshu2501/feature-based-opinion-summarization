---"i recently bought this device to upgrade from the nokia n81 8gb, and so far i don't regret my decision.what i like about this 5800 xpressmusic:1.- it has great reception2.- it is light (lighter than n81)3.- the big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero calibration (not like the palm tx i used to have some years ago)4.- the sound is even better than the one in the n815.- the internet experience flows very well, you can even watch videos from youtube right from their website6.- gps... mixed feelings tough, nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7.- the menus are very easy to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or create folders to your own preference.8.- you have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9.-the accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display.10.- it comes with a micro sd 8gb (reads up to 16gb cards)11.- the pc suite works great for sync with pc12.- good to have a 3.2 megapixel camera (although i would only use it for emergencies, since the quality of small sensors is on the very low side)13.- nice calendar, helps keep up with duties (although i would like some color code for different activities or meetings, something i liked from the palm tx -although this is not the strength of this device, it is music, so well forget what i just said...)on the weaker side,1.- you cannot see the phone number of any of your contacts when you have dialed it." **** 'nice'
---"(still a defect also found in n81, you have to enter in the contacts to do that)2.- gps has very low reception, so even a tinted window of the car can block the signal3.- battery life does not seem to last as much as nokia claims.4.- i miss the 4 way button from n81 (htc has one for their touch screen models too) this is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link.5.- plastic feels like the shell of an egg (but i guess that's the only way to get small but technologically complex devices)6.- does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the n81 came with an excellent one from factory)7.- terrible image organizer and editing." **** 'touch'

---"the 5800xm being the first mainstream handset from nokia is certainly a product that lives upto its brand name.the phone has quite a few cons, but the pro's of the handset weigh them out...pros:- price...very affordable (for an unlocked quad band 3g touchscreen)- slim form factor (fits right in the palm for single handed use)- audio quality- 3.5mm jack (but i guess thats standard on xpressmusic series)- fast response (i think it has an arm11 359mhz processor)- symbian has lots of apps, and newer apps coming quite fast for v5 (optimized for touchscreen)- inbuilt gps that works with google maps app.- 8 gb card and tv out video cable in the box.- symbian has lots of themes.cons:- the touchscreen is resistive, so won't exactly give you the iph**ne feel but you get handwriting recognition... not much use but still a feature- single click- double click  operation a little confusing- interface is typical symbian... if you've used nokia before, then its a short learning curve.- the ridged edge around the screen tends to accumulate some dust/lint after being in-out of the jeans pocket a couple of times.overall, i'd say its a great handset for the price...and no carrier contract!!" **** 'newer'
---"i liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.apps  : 2/10====yes, there is an app store, but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity, but if you have used any android/iphone app - you will realize that nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.touch screen: 3/10=====================first of all this is a resistive touch screen, means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work, unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.so the nokia's resistive touch screen works, but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesradio : 3/10======it does have a radio, but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna." **** 'available'
