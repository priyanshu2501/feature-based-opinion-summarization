Positive Reviews:

---'i bought this phone about a month ago to replace another phone i had it was like a blackberry phone but was not one.. i loved it,and still have it but i was bored of it and wanted something smart/newer with video capabilities as well.. at first with these reviews on here,i was back and forth as some were bad an others good..i do not find nothing wrong with this phone,except it does take time to get used to like any other new phone you get.i do find that it is a little slower if you have too many texts in there,so you will need to keep them pretty cleared out.. or yes it will slow down the phone.id recommend this to anyone looking for a sleek fun phone and more up to date.. i just popped in my sim card and without a problem i was up and running..i used this on a contract plan not a pre paid...so i would recommend if you do use a contract do not use the sim card provided in package when it comes just pop out the sim in your old phone and switch.' **** 'wrong'
