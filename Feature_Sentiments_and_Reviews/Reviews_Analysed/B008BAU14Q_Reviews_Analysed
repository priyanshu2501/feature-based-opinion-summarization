---"Some of the moderators and more technologically-experienced users deduced that the jumps and twitches were due to a cracked digitizer that came as a result to a drop and can be replaced by HTC or your carrier for roughly $35 (I'm not sure if the prices are different since the posts are from 2012)I know the phone owners, such as myself, are at fault for dropping our phones." **** 'due'
