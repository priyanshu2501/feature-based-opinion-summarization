---")so goes through alot of minutes,so this unlimited really appeals to me,so i bought her this phone as a trial run,(i figure its a good gamble,no contract etc)and i have to say we have had no problems with calls in or out like other reviewers have noted,the 4g works great(i did read all reviews so spent a few more bucks for an extended life battery that works well)........the internet works very well although i havent sprung the $15 extra a month to use it as a mobile hotspot,if i do i will update this review.the 3 g works well also,ahvent tried the wifi yet but will update as i try these things out.i live in baltimore so am guessing that is why the service is good and havent dropped a call yet,(i am sure it will happen as even the mighty verizon it happens.the phone is large but comfortable to use,i did note the manufacturer states not to hold the phone at the base as that interupts the signal as this is,apparently,where the ariel is,(why it isnt located in the top same as other phones i am not sure,just surmising it is due to all the goodies loaded in it),..................if you are switching from a non android phone it will take alittle while to get used to,had no problems transferring contacts,picture and video from her blackberry,used the bluetooth,which ofcourse,is quick and she is set up,havent had any phone 'freezing'as noted by other reviewers,so am happy about that.i am an 'a typical guy',dont use many minutes..........maybe 30 or so in a month,just rely on the usual neanderthal grunts.as i noted,the phone is large,but not ridiculously so,comfortable to use and to me,i really like the screen size,comes loaded with alot of apps i will rely on my 12 yr old niece to inform me of what they are and if i will need to use them!phone feels substantial not heavy not light,i do agree with another reviewer,the back case does come off alittle too easy but purchasing a protective case did remedy that minor irritant quickly,a word to the wise,it is wise to buy a car charger too for those who talk and text alot over the period of the day." **** 'extended'
---"(that and the extended life battery were my first add ons for my good lady),now if this is to be your first android phone,be advised these are inelligent type phones and do alot of things automatically,ie when transferring contacts,pictures and video from another phone it will allocate them accordingly.............took me awhile after using my beloved blackberry for so long but got up to speed ewith the basics really quick and a visit to the htc website made me realise this is a good operating system,i am no boffin just an average joe so somethings were hit or miss but picked it up after a couple of ooofer moments.i would advocate buying directly from the virgin website as if you dont like the phone you can return it within 30 days(other places like retail store will smirk at you and decline the return in most cases as the box is 'open',or buy from amazon if they sell these or are fulfilled by amazon,if not,check the return policy before buying incase this phone is not for you.i purchased this direct from virgin as they are offering 20% off for awhile and have a good return policy.customer care is the typical sprint(not great).in closing we are currently happy with this phone but will update over time to follow up after having used this for 6+months and thereafter.amazon has plenty of accessories for these to cater to nearly every taste,just pay attention to what you buy as the htc models are often seperated by a single letter.short update.....................came home to find an annoyed wife,the phone switches to sleep mode after sometime of inactivity,same as a computer,so the pwr button wont wake it back up so she had to pull the battery.................quickest solution(as i do read instructions) is to go to settings>display>never off and now all is good in the world with my good lady,still havent found any flaws in the phone like some other reviewers,phone,text and internet work fine as does the wifi and 4g/3g.will update as i go." **** 'extended'

__________('device',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'these are pretty generous specs by any measure, and it shows- the device is able to run pretty much any app smoothly, even the more graphically intensive games.' **** 'able'

Negative Reviews:

__________('call',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i replaced the phone with thelg optimus l9 p769, 4g (t-mobile), which so far has clearer call quality, better speakerphone, improved on-screen keyboard with more space between keys, blazing fast 4g where i used to have 1x, and is about half as heavy.i got mine in november 2012, and it was ok at first.' **** 'clearer'
---")so goes through alot of minutes,so this unlimited really appeals to me,so i bought her this phone as a trial run,(i figure its a good gamble,no contract etc)and i have to say we have had no problems with calls in or out like other reviewers have noted,the 4g works great(i did read all reviews so spent a few more bucks for an extended life battery that works well)........the internet works very well although i havent sprung the $15 extra a month to use it as a mobile hotspot,if i do i will update this review.the 3 g works well also,ahvent tried the wifi yet but will update as i try these things out.i live in baltimore so am guessing that is why the service is good and havent dropped a call yet,(i am sure it will happen as even the mighty verizon it happens.the phone is large but comfortable to use,i did note the manufacturer states not to hold the phone at the base as that interupts the signal as this is,apparently,where the ariel is,(why it isnt located in the top same as other phones i am not sure,just surmising it is due to all the goodies loaded in it),..................if you are switching from a non android phone it will take alittle while to get used to,had no problems transferring contacts,picture and video from her blackberry,used the bluetooth,which ofcourse,is quick and she is set up,havent had any phone 'freezing'as noted by other reviewers,so am happy about that.i am an 'a typical guy',dont use many minutes..........maybe 30 or so in a month,just rely on the usual neanderthal grunts.as i noted,the phone is large,but not ridiculously so,comfortable to use and to me,i really like the screen size,comes loaded with alot of apps i will rely on my 12 yr old niece to inform me of what they are and if i will need to use them!phone feels substantial not heavy not light,i do agree with another reviewer,the back case does come off alittle too easy but purchasing a protective case did remedy that minor irritant quickly,a word to the wise,it is wise to buy a car charger too for those who talk and text alot over the period of the day." **** 'sure'
---'i spent about two hours total with two separate phone calls on hold most of the time and the first call got disconnected so i had to start again.' **** 'first'

---'a friend placed a call in front of me and my phone did not even register the call.' **** 'register'

---"i've never really been exactly content with the service from either provider, but my older vm phone used to at least be on par with t-mobile.the phone gets very hot when making calls, so much that i use bluetooth or speaker whenever possible, and the battery has a knack for running down within 30 minutes of being unplugged if it feels like it.camera quality is totally unacceptable with blurry, hazy shots in all but the brightest light, and even then the colors are washed out." **** 'unacceptable'
---'call quality is good when you are in an area with decent service.' **** 'good'
---"call quality is good, sounds nice and clear like any other phone i've used, land line or cell phone." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---'service reception continued to be poor even in urban areas and call quality was poor for people on the receiving end.' **** 'poor'
---'you don\'t feel like you\'ve "settled" walking around with this thing.pros:- solid construction, it just feels well-made- newer (4.0 ice cream sandwich) android os- htc is very hacker-friendly, easy to root and customize- htc\'s sense ui is actually quite nice- call quality is good, audio is clear on built-in speaker- speakerphone is good and loud- cases for the sprint evo 3d fit perfectly, so lots of choices- screen is big (but not huge), bright and colorfulcons:- average battery life (around 6-8 hours depending on use)- battery cover is a little loose in spots- 3d camera is a useless gimmick, the camera enclosure is huge, and easily scratched- low-level hiss over headphones when listening to quiet music- can get heavy after a while, not good for small pocketsoverall i just love this phone.' **** 'good'
---'the 2d camera is decent, as is call quality.' **** 'call'

Positive Reviews:

---'that includes while i\'m texting and browsing, with various applications running in the background.google play offers hundreds of great apps for free, unlike my ipad and the apple store...more specifically i noticed when searching for educational and children\'s apps, such as "autism apps" google play offers a very large number of apps compared to that of the apple store..[tested and verified]i have not tested the speed of the 3g or 4g network, but as far as signal strength go\'s.' **** 'free'

---'for the battery*currently i unplug my phone in the morning at 9am, and some days by 12-3pm its already almost dead with just light to moderate use.. other days lasts until 6-7pm, its like having a corded phone againcalled htc they do not acknowledge your date of purchase on amazon as the begining of your warranty, so according to them my phone is out of warranty 6-7 months old even though it has a 1 yr manufac.' **** 'dead'

Negative Reviews:

---"virgin mobile operates under sprint's networkand so far im impressed @ the 4g im getting 15mb/s sometimes 20mb/s i get full 4g bars @ home but when somewhere else 1-2 but still it does 10 - 7mb/sas for battery life it sucksbut for extra 20$ you can get a 3460mah battery that lasts for 2 days and you can leave 4g on and watch youtube all day etc.this is the battery you need to last for many days even maybe 20x than the original batterylaza zcell 3460mah htc evo 3d extended battery + coverelse if your just a person who just checks facebook once awhile and don't stream too much then the original battery is okay for you.3g is ok i guess (sprint is working on it with network vision)i love the speed of the phone it just flies i have an iphone 4 and this is way faster than it and it seems way smoother than my iphone 4 with ios 6 on iti like the android ics and the google play and i just love how this phone handles on 3d and gaming and even just plain old games.5/5 for thisbefore you buy this phone check @ clear ( just google clear wire and click the top link and click coverage)for 4g coverage if your covered there then your covered with 4g on this phone because sprint uses clearwire's wimax towers." **** 'last'
