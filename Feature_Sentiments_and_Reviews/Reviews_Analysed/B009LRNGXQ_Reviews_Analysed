---'i will never buy a phone on line without knowledge of how it works...my mistake #1. i did read all about it and the reviews but thought it would work out as i only need a phone for emergencies...well, the emergency would be over by the time i get the phone on, unlocked and unlocked again and get it to move to contact and to all the other things to get help...my 6 year old phone was a simple goto idea and now this phone is a project to get service.now, why did i not just return it?because i thought i just had to get past the learning curve and made the mistake of calling tracfone to get my1818.6 minutes transferred over to the old phone...i got connected to a person after numerous trial and error numbers and voice only conversations and number crunching...this took 1:12 min...then the real fun...i could hardly hear person and he did not speak clear english...i told him what i needed (ihave delt with no problem in past 6 years of buying air time with tracfone)...he did not understand at first...after entering dozens of codes and giving a ton of info...he took off all my minutes from old phone and it shut down...ah, that is good !' **** 'past'

---"its a phone.. that's all you can say about it.. it calls.. sometimes.. it texts.. sometimes.. it gets calls.. sometimes.. it gets texts.. sometimes.. the back button and the browser button are shared so you spend half your time cancelling the browser.. it has no muted vibrate selection only.. you can't get any sort of protective case for it.. the querty keys are great but they replicate alot so you spend so much time correcting what you are sending.. the pictures and video do not like to transfer to any other object.. and.. the newest problem is this.. my rec'd texted messages somehow got switched into conversation view and now you can not change it back and you are unable to access your text messages or delete them.. you only have one chance to read it, but you have to be careful since the button to view double pushes alot.. and your phone can only hold so many texts before you can receive no more.. i will never buy and lg anything ever again.." **** 'newest'
