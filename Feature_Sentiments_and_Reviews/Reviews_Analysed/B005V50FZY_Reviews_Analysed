---'(stated their policies are universal with att).the phone tends to be slow at times when you give it a touch screen command.summary: if you do not use bluetooth, it is a very nice phone for the price.i returned the phone, on the basis that the bluetooth did not meet my expectations.' **** 'touch'
---'no complaints here for the avail.the avail has a very, very nice touch screen system that is easily mastered and quite responsive without being prone to mistakes.' **** 'nice'
---"you can't configure the sensitivity of the touch screen, or calibrate it." **** 'touch'

__________('data', 'plan')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i did have to pay extra for a data plan.overall, being a first timer, i have no idea how it compares to other android phones or iphones, but the phone is great for someone like me.' **** 'extra'
---"a quick google will show that many people did in fact want the phone for specifically that type of usage, and who are pretty upset about the change.it's still a pretty good backup phone for infrequent calls and texts, or if you do want to purchase a monthly plan and add a data package." **** 'add'
---"i was happy to learn that i can disable data and just use wifi when i'm at home if i want to download apps or go online without paying for a data plan; since i really just use my phone for calls and text messages.the phone has great sound quality even when it is on speakerphone." **** 'happy'

Negative Reviews:

__________('customer', 'service')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i will get another prepaid phone for my wife but i will do more research on the terms first and not assume prepaid means prepaid.i give go-phone 2  stars because of the phone quality seems pretty tough for the price and customer service, once you get past the seemingly endless "automated always happy lady", was helpful enough to tell me i needed to buy a new sim card or phone.i wouldn\'t have even written this if my wife (with our 4 kids) didn\'t have to flag down a total stranger to help her instead of calling for help herself, hence "emergency phone".' **** 'past'
---'went to the store and they just said they couldn\'t (more like feeling not to help) \'cause my phone is a 4g and that gophone just works on 3g but "kindly" offered me (not for free) one of their phones...also, they refused to call customer care \'cause they knew already the answer...worst customer service ever seen and wasted money!' **** 'worst'
---'will cancel with them this week, they are not that great and there are lots of other services out there that can do just as good or better,,,,not real hard to be better.horrible customer service!!!!!' **** 'hard'

Negative Reviews:

---"pros: e-mail, browsing, wifi works great.cons: flash browsing not supported by default.can't put the latest flash onto it.bluetooth has several problems ranging from not connecting right, to straight up not working.bad customer service experience from att store." **** 'straight'

================================================================================================================
__________('home',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'for example, lg thrive has a nice home screen widget to turn on/off 3g network, while on avail i have to go to settings every time when i switches network.in summary, at&t; avail from zte is an excellent prepaid smartphone for its price.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---"based on my experience with both phones, here is the comparison of those two phones:at&t; availpros:* larger screen (3.5in compared with 3.2in lg thrive)* better looking (maybe it's my personal preference, i think the black avail looks good)* newer android 2.3 system (thrive uses 2.2)* better camera - 5m vs 3m thrive* more stable wifi connection (wifi connection of thrive is not so reliable in my home." **** 'reliable'
---"i'm sure the cellphone snobs will tell me, but you can't use it online when away from home and that's true, unless i get lucky and pick-up a wifi signal, but i don't need the internet away from home." **** 'true'

__________('texts',)__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---'it cheaper even with there 1000 texts and minutes package.' **** 'cheaper'
---'to be honest, there were 2 texts on the phone but both of us dismissed them as another irritating facebook promotion.an email or a call (even automated) to the primary number on the account would have been appreciated before complete disconnection and i would have gladly put on more money.' **** 'honest'
---'(also my emails took a really long time to load)however i understood that this phone (android avail) was a lot cheaper than an iphone, so i continued to over look these minor issues...until i received a message on 07-25-2012. the phone alerts me that my memory is at full capacity and that i needed to delete my text messages in order to receive any future texts.' **** 'future'


================================================================================================================

---'this phone is great, i am able to add apps and make it even better.' **** 'able'
---'you can put a lot of apps on your sd card, but most of the really good, useful apps need phone storage to work properly.' **** 'good'
---"i will not say that it is as simple to use or that it is as integrated as my iphone was, but it has gps, apps, and i have found that many of the free apps from my iphone have fuller versions on android's market also for free.pros: price- $25 a month for unlimited texts and 250 minutes + $5 every other month for data.screen size- about the same as my iphone 3g.apps- wider selection than i was led to believe.call clarity and speakerphone volume." **** 'free'
---'easy to use and to get apps for.' **** 'easy'
---"so it's a very, very bad travel phone.another problem is the myriad of apps this thing comes with which you can't remove." **** 'myriad'
---'i had to delete some of my favorite apps because of it.' **** 'favorite'
---"this phone is so full of apps when it comes in the box, that you can't put anything else on it other than a few small apps." **** 'small'
---'even though i have never used a single one of these apps, i have had to keep them on the phone.another thing is that att offers unlimited talk, text and web for 50$.' **** 'single'

Negative Reviews:

---"one down side would be that it does have a really small amount of memory, while it does come with a sd card it can't handle too many extra apps that need to be saved to the phone's memory itself." **** 'extra'
---'seeing that is carries a 600mhz snapdragon processor i believed it to be a bit faster than the iphone 3g but running heavy apps on this phone is a night and day difference, maybe because it also carries 512mb of ram.all in all, if your on budget and need a fast reliable smartphone, this is a good choice.' **** 'heavy'
---'there are pre-loaded apps/software that i will never use that i am not able to remove which are taking up space and preventing me from loading new apps at this point.' **** 'new'
---'other apps with camera has no problem.' **** 'other'
---'it is a beautiful display, if not the best, hi res out there.pre-loaded apps are pretty good from at&t.' **** 'good'


================================================================================================================
__________('nternal', 'memory')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i would say the only thing that anyone could remotely complain about is the lack of internal memory (although you can expand the phones capabilities up to 32 gigs,) you need internal memory to run much of it and store cache files natively and the screen keyboard which is on the small side.' **** 'much'
---'the internal memory is laughable at best and it always says that the memory is full, even if i only have 2 text conversations on the phone and everything else saved on the micro sd card.' **** 'best'
---'i have had to purchase another charger in order to even start using the phone.another thing is that the phone only has 150mb of actual internal memory.' **** 'actual'
