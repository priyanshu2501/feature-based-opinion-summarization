__________('plan',)__________


Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"i turned on the music player and left it on speaker to see how long it would take to drain the thing and after 4 hrs and less than half the battery gone gave up.-camera isn't that great but is more than adequate for a phone like this.-i like that i can turn off data services and keep wi-fi on so that i don't get clipped in the us for a blackberry plan and can still use data from wi-fi(obviously not as great if you don't have regular wi-fi spots but if data is that important to you then you can always purchase the plan)-the screen isn't that big(it is more than adequate though)  it is bright and crisp-interface is good and i like having a smaller phone with the blackberry ball-music production quality is really good and doesn't drain the battery(see above) plus the ability to expand the memory is nice.-basic memory included is really not adequate if you are going to actually use this as a blackberry or music phone but i picked up a microsd 4gb for less than $10 and am so far happy so plan on buying a card-phone seems pretty durable but i haven't had it that long so i will update this as i go-i have read some reviews about the phone being to slow or not working etc." **** 'happy'
