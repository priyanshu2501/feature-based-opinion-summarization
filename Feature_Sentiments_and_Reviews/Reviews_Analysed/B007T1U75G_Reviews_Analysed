Positive Reviews:

---'The phone is blasting fast, the system updates have been really good so far, one can really watch full HD movies in it and the main reason why i bought this phone (the camera) just works over 9, 000 XD it shoots pictures right when you press the button and they are sick beautiful and clear - I have compare it with the iPhone 5, and its left behind by way far quality pictures :PWe might only complain (as everyone else does) about the non-removable battery and i use it 90% of the time in &#34; Power saver&#34; mode but that should be expected since it has to feed all that hardware.' **** 'compare'

---"Battery seems solid and all apps that I've tried are working great." **** 'solid'
---'HTC should have made the phone a tad thicker, so the camera lens is flush with the back (it sticks out), and use the extra interior space for a bigger, and removable, battery.' **** 'removable'

Negative Reviews:

---"it's one of the best phones I have ever used I would like to say it's perfect but there only one bad thing about which is the battery life is very short." **** 'short'

---"Battery isn't impressive, but not bad.-The 8 MP Camera deserves all the fuzz it received when first introduced, its pictures are steady, colors are vivid and quality is really high!-Speed: The phone handles multitasking very well, games and videos are a breathe nothing you should worry about here." **** 'impressive'
---"Of course you can buy an extra battery with the S3 and swipe batteries cos the one X has a built in battery which the user can't replace on his own, but again you can buy a charging case for the oneX!" **** 'extra'
---']Original review follows :HTC should be praised for creating such a magnificent phone, and PUBLICALLY FLOGGED for giving it a scandalously inadequate battery---presumably just to make it sexily thin.' **** 'inadequate'

Positive Reviews:

---'I sold the at&t; over eBay and bought the unlocked international version with 32 GB built in memory, which was a bit more expensive but was definitely worth it!-----------UPDATE 2------------One thing people may need to consider is that if you are  using this phone in the US, you are NOT getting 4G internet nor even 3g!' **** 'international'

Negative Reviews:

---'>>BUYERS BE WARE, there are many versions of this phone, the US at&t; version is a 16 GB version, people unlock it via an unlock code and sell it as an unlocked international version, the international one has 32 GB & comes without the at&t; logo on the front.' **** 'international'

---'Same goes to the international version of the Galaxy S3, The rep told me that the Samsung works only as a 2G phone as well on at&t;, though it is really fast overseas, cos it is obviously meant to work there.' **** 'international'
---'I have to assume that since it is an AT&T; phone then the hardware specs are also different from those of the international version--16 gb memory instead of the 32 in the int version, no quad processor but the dual one  of the AT&T; version, etc.' **** 'international'
---'It indeed has the AT&T; Logo on the front cover but otherwise it appears to be the international version with the quad processor and the 32 gb of memory.' **** 'international'

---'I missed how great the OneX screen was, I certainly missed how awesome HD vids looked on the screen, also I missed the slightly better camera, so I gladly paid the $35 restocking fee for at&t; and again returned back to the OneX, black this time since the white one caught stains fairly easily and had to be cleaned from time to time!' **** 'better'
---'I am on a world travel now and i dont miss my camera even a bit.' **** 'miss'

Negative Reviews:

---"And you can't really feel it unless u spent some time with the OneX's gorgeous screen, colors aren't vibrant, a picture of a clear sea looks darker and less colorful on the S3 than the One X and though really good, the One X is considerably better.- The camera is good, but again the One X's camera is definitely better both outdoor & indoor, may be not by much but the difference is there.- Eye tracking: It was supposed to prevent the screen from sleeping when you are reading or surfing, well it doesn't do the job very well." **** 'good'
