---"battery seems solid and all apps that i've tried are working great." **** 'solid'
---']original review follows :htc should be praised for creating such a magnificent phone, and publically flogged for giving it a scandalously inadequate battery---presumably just to make it sexily thin.there are two problems with the battery: not only is it inadequate to get through even a day of normal use, but worse yet it is a permanent (hard-wired) battery, iphone style, so you can not replace it with a higher capacity battery.' **** 'inadequate'

---"actually light use easily gets you through the day.of course you can buy an extra battery with the s3 and swipe batteries cos the one x has a built in battery which the user can't replace on his own, but again you can buy a charging case for the onex!both have nfc which i didn't use in the ~ two weeks period with each phone.-------conclusion-------if you want a better screen and camera definitely go with the onex, you will regret you didn't go with it when you see one in comparison with the s3!if you are a media fanatic who needs a lot of space, the the onex isn't for u, the s3 is as good as a phone, even with a lower screen but with extra micro sd card slot." **** 'extra'
