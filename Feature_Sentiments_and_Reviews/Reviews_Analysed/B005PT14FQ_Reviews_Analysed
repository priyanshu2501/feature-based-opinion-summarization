Negative Reviews:

---"but i am very happy with this device as well.vs iphone 4si cannot really argue against the value of the iphone 4s, but the gs2 is 50$ cheaper if you want the base model, and much cheaper if you want the extra-storage by buying microsd yourself (and more portable).the iphone 4s has an objectively better screen with denser pixels, but the gs2 screen is very nice, brighter and 0.8'' (~2cm) longer in the diagonal.the iphone 4s has a better camera.iphone4s is smaller, but that also means smaller screen.most importantly though, is the software: this is an android, and it let you do pretty much whatever you want to it." **** 'happy'
