---"its low light capabilities are a bit weaker than the iphone 4s but again, coming from a feature phone with a 2.3 mp camera that could barely produce a recognizable image in low light, the razr m camera is very adequate.all in all, i'm very happy with the razr m, and i'd give it 5 stars if not for the bloatware issue that verizon has caused by insisting on putting all kinds of amazon and other partner apps in a phone that only has 8 gigs of storage internally.i looked at several alternatives before deciding on the m. the galaxy siii was just a bit awkward in size, felt a bit cheaper in quality, and the screen wasn't quite as bright." **** 'bright'

---"they're getting better and better.first, the size is nice." **** 'nice'
---'the edge to edge design makes the overall size of the phone feel smaller and lightweight and fits great in my hand, even though the screen is large.and although i do not use it much, for what its worth, being able to talk and surf web, etc at the same time is amazing.' **** 'overall'
---"my battery last 2 days.-screen size is great, i like how small the phone is yet i can watch videos with 4.3 inch screen in hd!-phone size is small and thin, whole new world of large screened phones.-fully customizable like all droids-beautiful sleek look, aluminum border, kevlar backing, corning gorilla glasscons:-because the border is aluminum painted black it will show silver at the edges of the screen with time, but no biggy-not a huge selection of cases and covers available, which is to be expected with any brand new phone-smart actions app doesn't always work and drains a significant amount of battery life." **** 'small'

---"i'll get used to it in time.in short if your looking for a feather lite, powerful, and quick smartphone with a nice size display, but don't want a big bulky lump, then this is the phone for you." **** 'nice'
---'i upgraded from a samsung captivate (galaxy s) to the droid razr m after looking at all possible carriers options in the market.the reasons i chose verizon over at&t; (my previous carrier)* better signal coverage in my area* new 4g lte verizon phones are global, meaning they can be unlocked and used in other countries using a sim card.the reasons i chose the droid razr m over other phones:* 1.5 ghz dual processor: not many phones in the sub-4.5-inch class have a fast or dual processor* 4.3" screen size: to be fair, i got this phone hoping to push it to my wife once the 4.7" inch droid razr hd comes along.' **** 'fair'
---"it's unfortunate because i liked the size and features." **** 'unfortunate'
---'the user interface is vastly improved and the phone more well thought out than the droid 2. things that i like:pros:-the size is not too large like the samsung galaxy iiis; size is good for your pocket-folder arrangement is easier to get to and more intuitive-settings is located as the first screen to the left of the main screen; makes it easy to turn on and off things (wifi, bluetooth, etc.' **** 'good'
---'best smartphone i have ever had, small size but large screen is a plus and the thinness makes it look sleek and rugged with the high grade materials.' **** 'small'
---"it's small but has the same size screen as the bionic." **** 'small'

---'i was looking at the other razr phones and the samsung s3, but they where all too big for my taste.' **** 'other'
---'if you really need a big screen, go for the new razr hd and hd maxx.' **** 'new'
---'on the sd card.about my only complaint is that the white razr m has a black foreground around the screen, inside the white case.' **** 'white'
---'verizon changed out my phone with a razr hd which is a similar phone but has a slightly different antennae which so far seems to be working far better than the razr m.  batter life is good as well.' **** 'better'
---'lucky me, the razr m had just been released, at that point, still with v4.0.' **** 'lucky'
---"we are in our early 70s and love my wife's new razr m.  it's made our stand alone gps obsolete - - better and much faster." **** 'new'
---"it has the same inner cpu as the more expensive phones, i didn't notice any difference in graphics from the s3  and the razr m. the battery life is much better then the regular razr, and so far it's lasting longer then the s3." **** 'regular'

Negative Reviews:

---"my original razr took better pictures than my razr m.overall, its a great phone and i would highly recommend to anyone that doesn't want to spend $200-$300 on a phone!" **** 'original'
---"i've had motorola phones since the first razr flip phone, so i didn't hesitate to go with another when i chose this one.the screen does look good, the build on it is strong, battery life is decent, the signal is weak compared to the iphone 4s on the same network (and this is with no cover on the phone), but the terrible part for me is the w-fi.since new, on the first phone before trading it in for a refurbished one twice, and then on the subsequent phones, the wi-fi has been terrible at holding on to a network signal." **** 'first'
---'this phone is suffering from all the same android 4.x problems as the other razr phones.' **** 'other'
---"some friends of mine aren't so lucky with older razr models." **** 'lucky'
---"the iphone and the samsung white models look sharp with a different-color case against the white foreground...there is no such contrast with the white razr m.overall, this is easily the best phone i've owned, and i'm happy to recommend it to you." **** 'white'
---"its low light capabilities are a bit weaker than the iphone 4s but again, coming from a feature phone with a 2.3 mp camera that could barely produce a recognizable image in low light, the razr m camera is very adequate.all in all, i'm very happy with the razr m, and i'd give it 5 stars if not for the bloatware issue that verizon has caused by insisting on putting all kinds of amazon and other partner apps in a phone that only has 8 gigs of storage internally.i looked at several alternatives before deciding on the m. the galaxy siii was just a bit awkward in size, felt a bit cheaper in quality, and the screen wasn't quite as bright." **** 'happy'
---'we found that it is difficult to use razr as a phone, to simply make phone calls.' **** 'difficult'
