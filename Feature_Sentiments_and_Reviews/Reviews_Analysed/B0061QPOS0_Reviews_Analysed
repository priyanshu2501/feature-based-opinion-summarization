---'love all the apps available from amazon, especially the kindle for android app.' **** 'available'
---"you can become a data how a lot faster than you might imagine!apps: there's a ton of apps available from the android store, and amazon has done a pretty amazing job of providing apps for the phone on their site as well.so far, so good." **** 'available'
---'so to simplify my review here is a list of pros and cons.i recommend this phone because:it is powerful with a 1.5 ghz dual core processor snapdragon s3it has 1 gig of ramit has a gorgeous 4.5" super amoled plus sreen with scratch resistant gorilla glassit is very responsive and very fluidit is 4g lte for a very fast internet experience and downloadsit has 8 megapixel rear, 2 megapixel forward facing camerasit has hd video recording capabilitygingerbread is a very good operating system and it is slated for an ice cream sandwich updatethe battery is removable and you can carry a spareyou can add up to 32 gigabytes of micro sd memorycustomization is quite diverse in function and lots of gorgeous themes (widgets, change your icons, and many other cosmetic changes)i can play my itunes albums i ripped from my cd that once resided on my iphonei can connect it to my pc as an external hard drive both for the on-board and installed micro sd card with windows 7 with no drivers requiredi can transfer video files and play a lot of formatsthere are siri-like apps that have been available (although not as polished) even before siri (speaktoit, jeanie, vlingo)i can acquire super user status of the operating system if one so choosesit gives me very specific information on which programs are using the most energy and the state of the battery (temp, voltage, percentage)there are a lot of of great free apps and an app to remove annoying ads from free appsoh, and it makes phone calls with great call clarity on both endsmy complaints are:plastic, plastic almost everywhere (the battery/sim card cover is a very thin plastic backplate)the battery life is not that great at standard settings and requires me to throttle down the processor (yes, you can do that but not officially) and bring down the screen brightness to conserve power.' **** 'free'
---'i just bought samsung galaxy skyrocket ii phone 10 days back and i started using this phone and the phone display and android apps are good  but battery life sucks.' **** 'good'
---'the apps that come with this phone for free are awesome, and the amount of free apps and a lot less expensive apps are enough to sway smartphone users.' **** 'expensive'
---'since this is another personal thing for each individual buyer, i highly recommend before buying any phone, go to a store and wherever possible, handle a phone yourself and get a feel for how it sits in your hands before spending your hard-earned money to buy it only to be upset a week later because its too big--or too small for your hands.the apps available are growing exponentially in the android market (over 450,000 at last count, fast approaching apple) which almost makes it a wash if that is why you are choosing one phone over another--but even so, there still are apps exclusive to apple and also to android.' **** 'small'
---'be aware that the more apps you install, the more will run in the background.' **** 'aware'
---"i suspect that the few negative reviews that i've read are because folks downloaded a ton of free apps, installed them not knowing they run in the background." **** 'free'
---"i should also mention how it multitasks perfectly, no freezing up!there is also a bunch of free apps on the app store that apple doesn't have!" **** 'free'

---'i adjusted the email polling to 1 hour during work hours and 4 hours off peak, used powersaver, stopped apps with an easy to use att widget and right this second have 83% of battery with 4 hours of fairly significant use including several phone calls, sms, and manual email syncs.' **** 'easy'
