Positive Reviews:

---'so well, let me take this point by point, the torch 2 is an interesting phone, the design is good and so on, let me break this down for you.features -a) 5 megapixel camera, a fast processor, some inbuilt memory, os 7.0 and camera with flashb) a very stable battery life, possibly the best i\'ve had since the original blackberry curvec) a "fair at best" speakerphoned) call quality was average, a step below all blackberries i\'ve used, signal is kinda choppy but that could be the network.e) the slide out qwerty keyboard gives you access to the standard blackberry keyboard.' **** 'best'

Negative Reviews:

---'the physical keyboard, extended display, touch capabilities, 5mp camera, excellent screen resolution, among others, make of the blackberry 9810 a great business smartphone.also, it offers fast performance, and internet browsing has been improved with the new os 7.i like its "sexy" design.only two minor drawbacks: battery life is less than two days, although some friends who use android phones tell me that their phone batteries are dead after just one day.' **** 'less'

Negative Reviews:

---"none of that surepress nonsense, and the screen was actually responsive enough to be of use when you didn't necessarily want to use the trackpad/keyboard.for all intents and purposes - the torch 9810 looks no different than the 9800. if you put them side-by-side, i'm not sure if anyone would be able to tell which is which." **** 'responsive'
---'hi this is my story withi this guys:i bought this bb torch 9810 on october 7th 2011 unlocked from this seller worldwide distributors, i used for 1 month here in peru without any problem, 1 day this message appears in the main screen "phone not allowed mm6" i search what was the meaning of this, ant it says that the imei phone was reported as stolen, lost or did not pay the bill, well i try too many times to contact this seller and finally he answers, and told me to send back the phone for refound, so i sent it back with a friend who went to the us, well, they received the phone and i wait for refound, so guess what?' **** 'main'
---"if you've never used a blackberry before, perhaps this is one you should try, since it has the touch screen keyboard as well, so you never need to use the slide if you don't want to, or if you just want to sit in starbuck$ looking like you know what you're doing.most carriers will let you exchange the handset for another if you do that within the week, should you decide you don't like it." **** 'touch'

---"something that impressed the heck out of me was the restoration of my blackberry backup - while available for other brands of handsets, the blackberry recovery was seamless, a bold 9700 backup restored to a torch 9810, without so much as a hiccup, this after the blackberry desktop i was using already updated the torch os automagically.some other stuff i really like: blackberry protect, which will let me locate and wipe the handset remotely, and i just connected the blackberry bluetooth modem to my sony vaio desktop, and found, much to my surprise, that the dialup modem settings i have always had to manually set for t-mobile aren't necessary any more, on the torch." **** 'necessary'
---"why, i don't yet know, but all this with non-custom drivers is quite astonishing, although i may be in nerd territory with this, i don't really know.highly confusing, to me, is that t-mobile is pushing (we're talking may 2012 here) the expensive blackberry bold 9900, when they have the blackberry torch 9810 still available." **** 'available'
