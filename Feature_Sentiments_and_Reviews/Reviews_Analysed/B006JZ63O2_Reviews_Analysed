Negative Reviews:

---'gotta root it and risk bricking your phone.- video cam mode can only record @ vga quality.- physical power button feels somewhat cheap/flimsy.- music player will randomly stop or freeze while listening to internet radio, maybe a gingerbread bug, the app updated itself yet issue persists.- included phone charger is of questionable quality, i ended up using my old blackberry charger instead.update:very poor screen performance in direct sunlight, dark themes and wallpaper help a tiny bit...had run into problems with the phone randomly rebooting.' **** 'poor'
