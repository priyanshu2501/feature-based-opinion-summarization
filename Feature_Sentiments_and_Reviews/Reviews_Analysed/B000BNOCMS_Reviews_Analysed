---'The second screen is not only an excellent way to take pictures of yourself (it acts as a "mirror" of sorts), but is also a great way to save battery life if you happen to be an impulsive cell phone checker (checking the external screen saves more battery life than opening and closing the phone), as you can check the time and date, as well as checking if you have missed calls, messages, or voice-mail.' **** 'battery'
---'Battery life is pretty good, and when you press the up key on the side of the phone, in the run down of details about your phone, it has a battery life percentage as well, so instead of having 1 2 or 3 blocks for judging battery life, you also have an actual percentage, which is nice.' **** 'good'
---'It can also display appointment information or phone information.- Bluetooth is easy to use and setup- Cool looking glowing lights around the keypad that light up in different ways when you receive a call.- It has great battery life (far better than the V551) and the charger is a lot more straightforward to use (the v551 requires jiggling and finessing to get it to work).- Some nice game demos are included although they are VERY short and the full version will cost you $7 bucks extra!!' **** 'better'
