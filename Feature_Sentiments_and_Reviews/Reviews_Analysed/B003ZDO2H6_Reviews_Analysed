---'The phone was fast and responsive, the screen was great, and I need a phone with a keyboard.' **** 'responsive'
---"Samsung is doing a great job of chasing Apple (too good if you keep up with legal news) and its products certainly threaten Apple's seeming stranglehold on appealing hardware.+ The screen is simply beautiful to look at... set with active wallpaper, it comes alive.+ The real QWERTY keyboard is an excellent feature which barely adds to the weight of the phone." **** 'beautiful'

__________('much', 'better')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"reasons i am blown away:very quick & responsive even when several apps running, touch keyboard is much better than i thought it'd be (especially with 'swype key'); hence, the reason i got a phone with actual keyboard (which i still use for longer typing)." **** 'much'
---"The voice dialing rocks, and it is a much better phone phone than the Pre, but if you're using the phone primarily to keep up with text messaging and emails, I think it is far inferior in these respects." **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---"Apps are often more quirky and not as restricted as Apple'sCamera is much better with more options." **** 'much'
