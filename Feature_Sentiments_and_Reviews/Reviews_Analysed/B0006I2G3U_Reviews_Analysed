---'also the place where i purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.the negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but i think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white lcd (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"my only gripe with this phone is that motorola's user-interface just doesn't have an apparent logic to it, and as a result you have to dig out the user manual time and again.also, if you use reading glasses, you will probably need them with this phone b/c there is no option to make the tiny letters in the display any larger, as is the option with some other phone brands." **** 'larger'
---'it actually has a little weight to make it feel like a phone (not an empty plastic shell of a phone) and the hinging on the flip is strong, i can actually put it to my face without feeling it want to bend backwards.the outside display is good too, very cool blue color scheme, true, no outside photo caller id, but you can pay a little more and get that in a different phone.if you want a reliable, well built, and "as advertised" phone this is the phone to get.' **** 'good'
