__________('battery', 'life')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"The only thing I didn't like was the battery life it was EXTREMELY short I don't know if it was just something wrong with my battery or what." **** 'short'
---"Very nice feature, since typing them in with the phone keyboard would have been tedious at best.-the screen is large & bright with nicely designed icons.- calls are clear, sound-quality is great - seems better than my old phone, as does the volume - can easily hear it if I leave it lying about the house- love the fact that you can set 'profiles' for indoor/outdoor and at a touch can select which one you want & it will automatically change the volume/vibrate settings for calls & texts, to the selected profile- can assign individual ringtones to your contacts- it is an overall good size - not too big for my pocket, but large enough to be comfortable talking & texting.- SPECIAL NOTE: I have not had trouble with the battery life - it typically lasts me a couple of days before needing re-charged." **** 'trouble'

Negative Reviews:

---'The battery life is very short; I have to charge it nightly.' **** 'short'
---'Battery life is poor, no wifi.' **** 'poor'
---'The location of the volume button means she is constantly unintentionally turning the ringer down and there are other quirky problems (touchscreen, poor battery life, etc.)' **** 'poor'
---'It takes all day to charge the battery, and after taking it off the charger it was flashing the "low battery" sign at me.' **** 'low'
---'Otherwise the touch screen if fairly responsive for a basic phone, the settings and options are decent, and there is a tiny amount of personalization to it that makes it just ok. Of the 2 AT&T; has right now, the other being the LG Expression, this is probably the better, my wife got the other and has had crazy battery issues, and though the personalization and ther &#34; processing&#34; speed is a bit better on the LG, the keys, touch screen, battery, and durability are better with the Pantech.' **** 'crazy'
