Negative Reviews:

---'I have found it to be one of the more accurate touch screens I have used, and multitouch gestures work consistently.- I had to mark it down slightly because the default backlight setting is much too dim and gets even dimmer when the sensor deems it appropriate.' **** 'accurate'
---"The screen is beautiful when the backlight is well-illuminated, but it's hard to read when it's often too dim at the default setting.- I immediately deactivated the touchscreen vibrations as they felt cheap and were noisy." **** 'beautiful'
---"I also believe that the SMS interface requires too many presses to navigate from a user interface perspective.- I have noticed that the touch screen doesn't work on hot, humid days." **** 'touch'
---"Unfortunately I have to say, the product arrived damaged or defective me, I get to touch damaged, when I opened the package, take the phone powered ON it with much emotion, lit it and I saw a line on the screen that I found rather odd, I started using it and Tacti malfunctioning, applications took me until I realized it was not me, was the PHONE NOKIA E6-00, which is really disappointing, the first purchase I do in the amazon store and I the product arrives damaged, you tell me now I can think of me from the store, and exacerbating this situation is that I'm from Venezuela and the cost and return shipping process is complicated, but will do my best to return it because it may be possible to buy a new product arrives damaged box and I hope to obtain a prompt solution to my BIG PROBLEM!!" **** 'odd'
---"After 2 months: (1) It turns off randomly and the power button doesn't work (I have to keep the power adapter at all times and plug it in to power back on); (2) The notifiction light does not work; (3) The touch screen activates various widgets without ever actually touching them; (4) The keyboard is unusable because of the diminutive size; (5) Despite having 8 megapixels, the pictures are mediocre (6) There is no support for this item." **** 'touch'
---'If i recall correctly, when i used the E71 and E72 i KNEW when i pressed a key, now i have to make sure i pressed it once in a while, or i have to make sure i haven\'t pressed two keys by mistake because i can\'t tell if i did just by the feeling of typing.- The directional Pad is fine, but annoying as the "Up" key will often let me touch the screen which responds to touch and mess up whatever i\'m trying to do on my phone.' **** 'touch'
---'The only problem is that some things are just too small due to the small screen and you have to touch a couple of times at neighboring spots before hitting the one you actually want.' **** 'due'
---'I never had full touch screen phone and I do not like touch screens for typing.' **** 'touch'
---'the third big minus.- Web browser is not the easiest to use.--- difficult to enter www address--- scrolling down while site is still loading would freeze UI for a second or two and when unfrozed it would rush to scroll down the page at the fast rate- multi-touch does not consider location where you pinch to zoom and zooms always off the center of the screen.- screen does not seem to have back reflector and is readable on direct sun light only due to the bright LED backlight.- no option to turn off touch screen sensor.' **** 'touch'
---'Screen is small but so is the phone and thanks to that fits well everywhere: jeans, sport coat, business suit: Screen is responsive and touchscreen experience is fluid as it should be with 25.' **** 'small'
---"The combination of querty and touch screen is really cool, you can't ask more for a cellphone of this size and with Symbiam OS, it sucks that for instance; LINE software doesn't exist for Nokia, but I got from this phone all what I need daily, it open 3 windows in the browser only but it is enough for navigating for addresses and stuffs, it is a plus that it has 3 different memory sources including the SD microcard, you can save lots of songs." **** 'touch'
