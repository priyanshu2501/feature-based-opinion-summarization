---'You trade off some features to get a bit more speed and slightly better battery life (just a speculation as the S4 is more energy efficient but the Xperia V comes with a smaller, replaceable battery).' **** 'replaceable'
---'Highest pixel density, best screen, fast, enough memory, acceptable battery life, water and dust resistant..' **** 'acceptable'
---"The battery is really bad, I have to charge it 2 or 3 times a day!, android is not consolidated, nor stable compared to iOS, the touch buttons are really bad, they don't work if you just &#34; touch&#34; them, you rather have to &#34; glide&#34; your fingers over them to work." **** 'bad'

__________('camera',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'4- The best camera offered on an android phone, a 12mp camera with Exmor-R technology for taking better pictures in low light conditions.' **** 'best'
---"Also don't expect this to replace your main camera other than for quick FB posts because there are quite severe noise issues (but they still look good)." **** 'other'
---'Also it has 8gb internal memory instead, a VGA front camera, and no dedicated camera button.' **** 'dedicated'

Negative Reviews:

---"The few physical buttons it has (power, volume, camera) are kind of weird to push, it seems it has some sort of sealing rubber that makes them sticky, and the worst part is that the more you use them they start going into the phone, which makes them harder to push; if that doesn't stop I'm afraid they might end inside the phone as a hollow and not a button." **** 'kind'
---'Similar camera sensor (13MP, but still same Exmor R, not RS), though with the S4 chip instead.' **** 'similar'
