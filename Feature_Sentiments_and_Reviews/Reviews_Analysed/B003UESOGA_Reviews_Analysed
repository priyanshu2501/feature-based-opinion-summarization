---'it is not frequent by any means, but it always seems to happen at the most inopportune times causing frustration.' **** 'inopportune'

Negative Reviews:

---"its only major flaw of the track pad--imo--was that you couldn't adjust its sensitivity like you could the old track balls used on older blackberrys (at least not that i could figure out), consequently making moving the curser a bit slow at times--but infinitely more accurate than having to resort to using your finger to place the curser where you want it." **** 'accurate'

---"i am sure after i get it figured out, i will think it fabulous, but i would definitely not recommend it for those who don't have the patience for complicated electronics - stick to the i-phone if you want web browsing, email, a good camera, great map feature, music and great apps with an ok phone.what i do really like about the droid x is the slide out keyboard, as i can use my fingernails to click on the keys much more accurately that the i-phone touch screen, plus you have numbers and punctuation right there together." **** 'good'
---"and finally i fell in with all the suckers and decided to actually wait to own the droid x.well, today it arrived....and while discerning folks will note that i can't talk about bugs or fixes yet, what i can share after being on this phone all day today is this:1. the camera is spectacular -- and, hello bb, it actually has a flash!" **** 'spectacular'

---'*screen is a good size, clear and crisp picture.' **** 'good'
---'*screen is a good size, clear and crisp picture.' **** 'clear'
---'it conducts heat very well, so the back does heat up at times but it cools down quickly too.while the screen is large, the overall size of the phone is not.' **** 'overall'
---'i was a little leary of its large size at first, but i quite like it now.' **** 'first'

---"this is necessary for the size of the screen though, which was the entire point of this phone model, so i can't complain too much here.-fragility; this is not something i know for sure, but i think i can safely assume that although this phone is a brick, that brick is made of glass." **** 'necessary'
---'slightly larger size is the price you pay for this, but since it does not go in my pocket, not a problem.the on/off button on the droid x i also find frustrating because it is so small and seems hard to find a push.' **** 'larger'

__________('time',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the thing i like most of the os is that it allows you plenty of customizing and even monitoring battery use per components; cell standby, display, voice calls, phone idle and bluetooth as well as an indicator of elapsed time since you last unplugged the device.' **** 'last'
---"and this is with barely touching the phone- checking the time a couple times, maybe a handful of texts or so, jumping online to check email real quick, and that's all.this morning, for example, i took it off the charger at 7:30 am, and by 9 am, when all i had done with it was get online to send a work email, it was down to 70%!whenever i take it off the charger, the screen is lit up but is completely black, and half the time hitting the physical buttons does nothing, so i have to pop the battery out and restart the phone.i also have to do that half the time i want to use my data connection- i'll get messages saying there was an error signing into facebook or twitter, or i'll try to pull up the internet and it won't work." **** 'black'
---'maybe i would have been better served by htc, but this is definitely the last time i purchase a motorola product!' **** 'last'
---"i'm sure that with some time the new will wear off and i will have more to say.bottom line: this is an excellent phone that has unlimited potential via app's to organize and simplify your entire life." **** 'new'

---"the droid x is best when it's fully charged, the only problem is that if you want to listen to music, or use apps that rely on the web or gps, you'd better have a spare battery, or access to a power outlet because the battery life will routinely go from 100% to 50% in 3-4 hours just looking up a few facebook updates, google maps and checking in at locations with yelp, or foursquare.it's very possible that just about everyday you get off of work your droid x will have used 60-75% of it's battery life." **** 'music'
---'based on my experience, the phone can not function without this application that shuts down other apps that are running in the background but are not in use.i am on my third week with the phone and i am considering returning it while it is still under the 30 day return policy.' **** 'other'
---'the problems have become worse, the phone constantly reboots on its own, apps are not functioning properly, apps open by themselves (a common problem according to verizon tech support), txt messages duplicating or sending several hours late, etc.' **** 'open'
---"i have an ipod touch so i'm familiar with what is in the apple app store and android apps are just as good." **** 'good'

---'there are apps available that let you terminate background tasks that helps conserve battery.' **** 'available'
---'the apps available so far have given a lot to brag about to android smartphones imo.it has bluetooth support for keyboards, mouses, hands free devices mono and stereo, and more.with hdmi out and aftermarket apps, you can treat it like a very small netbook.' **** 'available'
---"there are so many great apps for android, you just can't go wrong." **** 'wrong'

---'and the good news is lots of good droid apps are free!4.' **** 'free'
---"in both the camera and video you have to be careful of the effects which the camera seems to decide on its own to insert.the iphone has many advantages, but as i understand it, you can't replace the battery as you can in this phone.iphone camera has 5 megapixels which can make smaller prints, but isn't as good.i was finally able to download the apps i bought the phone to have and they work suitably well.so i will up my rating to 3 stars.1/31/2011- after a frustrating day of entering events into the camera, sending messages etc." **** 'able'
---"pros:-sweet little android that sets-up easy-big clear screen-plenty of apps with new ones daily.-excellent 3g and wireless speeds-good camera stills and movies-does it allcons:-there is very little not to like- but preferences will make some people give negative reviews:-it's too big (i waited for big)-it's too heavy (ditto)-it's not as good at ____ as... (user preference)-verizon is moving to tiered internet pricingsummary: let iphone fanatics call theirs a phone- this is a little computer that runs an operating system that isn't windows or mac." **** 'clear'
---"* the biggest objection though is that the apps are incredibly invasive, and the pitifully old school congress can't even figure out this stuff needs to be reined in (or they've already sold out to the phone/satellite companies.)" **** 'invasive'
