---"the smaller screen size allows it to be a little less cumbersome to carry in a pocket or holster than my razr maxx, which tends to dig in to my side while driving if it's in the holster, or not fit in a pocket with the otterbox defender on it.this thing was good for the reason i purchased it, but had there been a better deal on a newer model phone that has better battery quality, i'd definitely go with the newer generation of phone." **** 'better'

Positive Reviews:

---'it has been a very dependable and great working phone for the past 3 months now.' **** 'dependable'

Negative Reviews:

---"we both think it's a good looking phone, just not a good working phone.if you are looking for a good phone just to take pictures and call with, this is still not the phone for you!" **** 'good'
---'therefore if you are looking for a good working phone this is not the phone for you.' **** 'good'
---'the 1st phone i received from this supplier "cell lounge inc" was defective right out of the box and the second one stopped working about 6 wks later ( their policy is 30 days).' **** 'stopped'
