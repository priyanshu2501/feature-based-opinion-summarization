---"and from there, it's like setting up a regular android phone.idk why, but when setting up my phones, they never let me go solely with the option of setting up my accounts using cellular networks, always wifi, this phone was no different.all in all, akkachan (japanese for baby) is a cute little phone with the functionality of a &#34;regular&#34; sized one.also, the micro sd slot, is under the back cover." **** 'regular'

__________('size',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'if the screen size was larger, i think he would have loved it even more because he plays many games on it.' **** 'larger'

---'i also like the smaller size that is easy to carry in pocket.' **** 'easy'

__________('screen',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"samsung's touch screen and wifi connectivity are amazing." **** 'touch'
---"clearing because the screen is small, internet view isn't &#34;funny fun fun!&#34;, but still very much possible." **** 'small'
---"after you take the phone out of it's little wrapper, and hold down the power button for a few seconds, (it takes about 20 seconds to power on completely), the first screen i encountered was in turkish i believe(?)." **** 'first'
---'this phone is not for folks who cannot see the small screen very well.' **** 'small'

Negative Reviews:

---'despite the small screen, the text is very readable.' **** 'small'
---'good luck.i call this phone "semi-smart" because it does almost everything you\'ll need a smart phone to do but slower, with less screen resolution and a bit more hassle.that being said, a "semi-smart" phone is all that i need at this time.' **** 'less'
---'if you need more maybe you ought to buy something else.the quirks others have noted are real: a ridiculous need to tap the screen twice to hear a call after you\'ve already dialed it, and you\'ll even need to tap twice to end the call (unless you set the phone up so that you end calls with the power button).and the camera is almost impossible to use gracefully as the "snap the picture" button is on the touch screen and not on the body of the phone.' **** 'touch'
---"small screen but it's a nice phone." **** 'small'
