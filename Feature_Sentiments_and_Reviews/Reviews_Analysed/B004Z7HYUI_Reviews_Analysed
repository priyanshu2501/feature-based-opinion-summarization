---'i you require bluetooth all the time then do not buy this phone.3) camera fairly weak:  it has not flash, no auto-focus, and performs very poorly in low light, but what do you expect for a smart phone costing &lt;$200summary:  excellent choice if you want all the basics that an android phone has to offer.' **** 'weak'

Negative Reviews:

Positive Reviews:

---'last month i purchased this phone for myself at radio shack for 179.99. i regret it because here sold much cheaper.' **** 'last'
---"power users should probably keep a spare battery around but this is the same with all androids in my experience.- the swype keyboard is excellent- it's boost mobile, it runs on the sprint network and has all the excellent coverage sprint provides but it's only $55 a month, and less if you pay on time!the cons:- the phone comes with a severe lack of storage, and a bunch of preloaded apps you'll hardly ever use that cannot be moved to the sd card." **** 'less'

Negative Reviews:

---"unlimited contract's with the big 3 companies range from 69 per month (sprint) to $120 per month (verizon/at&t;), so let's just say $95 per month on average." **** 'average'
---'i will start off by saying that i have owned several high end devices and i am a loyal android geek so that being said please take into consideration the fact that i am talking to you based on my experience only after havig htc evo, htc evo shift and samsung epic 4g...ive had the phone for a whole month almost now soo here we go!the pros?-battery life: lasts a full day or more on stand by however you will understand why as i continue.-thin and lightweight.-decent resolution on screen (not the best but not the worst)the cons?-crappy camera with no flash.-crappy video playback.-lags a lot and internet force closes 6 oit of 15 times.-ram memory is the most insignificant ive seen since it always shows memory issues on the top left corner!-doesnt support as much memory for texts as you would expect because it fills up quick depending on how heavy of a texter you are.-touchscreen becomes unresponsive easily after holding it against your ear talking.bottomline this is a purchase i regret given the fact that the evos are now being sold flashed to boost and for less than 200.00!this is not a phone i would recomment to anyone who is an avid android user and is used to doing tasks on the fly, for the price of this phone i honestly wish they would carry something more decent!' **** 'whole'

---"the memory is so small that downloading just one 2014 app and updating the standard google apps can totally fill the memory and the phone then stops working.the prevail's extremely small internal memory requires you move as many apps as possible onto an sd memory card." **** 'possible'
---'many "free" apps are collecting info in the background, often they collect info that has nothing to do with its function.this is not just a privacy issue, it also slows down the phone and drain its battery.' **** 'free'
---'this is not the best android phone but a great phone just the same.if you root the phone you can remove the bloat apps that take upmemory storage.i would have given this 4 stars but dueto the lack of internal memory for app storagei only gave it 4 stars.calls are clear.' **** 'bloat'
---"be sure to move any apps you download over to the sd card so not to fill up the phone's internal memory space." **** 'sure'
---"even with an sd card i was constantly getting warning messages that my space was running out, then i couldn't update certain apps because there wasn't enough space to do so.in the end, i wound up switching back to my old metro pcs samsung, that is not a smart phone, but didn't give me a headache either.i would recommend that if you are looking for a smartphone, do your research and don't buy one just because it's cheap." **** 'certain'

---"this is my first smart phone.. and it is easy to use and most of the android apps are free... you can find an app for anything you want to do with this phone... the battery doesn't last all day... but its a mini computer... i guess that's how they all are, my son and daughter have smart phones theirs is the same way." **** 'free'

Negative Reviews:

---'apps that would be able to run off the memory stick i cannot download either, as the phone itself does not have enough space to allow download and transfer to the memory stick.also, the phone is now experiencing a kind of drive failure that has disabled me from downloading or updating any apps on the phone.' **** 'able'
---'most apps run smooth.' **** 'smooth'
---'android market has great free apps, games, widgets, etc.' **** 'free'

---'only certain apps can install to a microsd card.' **** 'certain'

---'i needed an android phone for business purposes and my limit was $50 as far as my monthly fees were concerned.i researched and found this particular phone and it is actually my very first android phone so i have nothing to compare it to.i was with straight talk for over a year and it served me well but the android phones that they had available at the time were not accommodating for my needs.the samsung galaxy precedent that they just introduced which can closely be compared with this one would have worked well w/me and i more than likely would have purchased it but they came out w/it after the fact.anyway, i am not "technologically savvy" so i needed something that was not going to require me to bust my brain trying to figure it out.i am so pleased with the simplicity of navigating this phone!i took an entire day of reading the manual, watching various youtube videos and just fumbling around with it and within days i was able to operate it with ease.i am told that it is a "lower level" android phone so i feel that it is the perfect phone to prepare me, (or any "newbie" like myself) for when i am ready to graduate to the next level :)the only issue that i have or "had" with this phone so far is that the battery life is literally non existent.' **** 'able'
