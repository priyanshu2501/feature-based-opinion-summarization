---"I have been using Windows Phone 7 since it came out back in late 2010, I upgraded from a HTC HD7 which was a very loyal and awesome phone and now that I have been using the Lumia 900 for 1 full month, I can honestly say that there is no other OS I would use after Windows Phone; My wife uses an Iphone 4S as well as my coworkers and my friends use different incarnations of Android and I have witnessed first hand their frustrations with their respective products; in fact, my wife has had to replace her first deffective Iphone 4S after barely 3 or 4 months of light use; They all agree that Windows Phone has the most User-friendly UI among all the OS and I have managed to create some converts who are in the process to trade their current Iphones for Lumia 900s; everybody is amazed at how excitingly different this phone is and I keep getting constant visits at my desk at work from people trying to admire and take a look at the OS for the first time, they all say that it possesses the most beautiful screen of any smartphone in the market today; I'm excited about what the OS has accomplished in this time and am even happier to be part of the fortunate group of people that decided to give this experiment a chance for we all have made it grow." **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'The user interface on the Windows Phone is more intuitive and cleaner than the iPhone.' **** 'cleaner'
---"I've been an iPhone user since the first iPhone came out and I was never into trendy apps because I barely have time to workout let alone play with Apps on my phone for an extended period of time." **** 'first'
---'Highly personable (live tiles, people hubs), consistent user interface (across all apps), unique features (FM radio, Tethering, Office/Social-media integration, Nokia Maps works offline) make it at minimum competitive to the iPhone in those aspects but what makes it distinguishable is the superior PHONE/NETWORK functionality and quality (clear calls, no drops, great speakerphone, superior compliance to network speeds and bandwidth), which was always meant to be the primary characteristic of any cell-phone.' **** 'minimum'

Positive Reviews:

---'Looks and feels expensive unlike some of the other WP7 phones out there.' **** 'expensive'
---"Really, my only nitpick is that despite the well-deserved praise for its build quality (it's literally seamless and feels very solid... whereas if you pick up, say, a Samsung Galaxy Nexus it feels cheap and plastic-y) there's not really any grip to the polycarbonate case." **** 'seamless'
---'Easy to hold and feels wonderful and solid.' **** 'solid'

Negative Reviews:

---'The Windows OS seems pretty solid, and feels more modern than iOS.' **** 'modern'

---'The Windows OS takes advantage of side whipping finger movements to navigate you through applications features which feels more natural that the iOS clicking all of these tiny buttons at the top of the screen.' **** 'natural'
