---"also, i guess the read-text feature is also a plus as she's not one to use a blue-tooth device while driving-hence why she never picks up the phone or answer calls until she's able.so, since she's not likely to post any reviews i figure i'd do it for her to provide good feedback for both future/prospective consumers and manufacture alike:1)phone seems to work great (i guess we received one of the units not affected by current network issues)2)screen resolution looks great." **** 'likely'
---'please review carefully for what "matters to you" as an individual so you can "educationally" vote on the pros/cons before committing to a purchase/contract.i really hate to see negative reviews about things that based on spec sheets where not available to begin with.let\'s remember to keep the reviews objective and not follow any manufactures blindly.' **** 'negative'
