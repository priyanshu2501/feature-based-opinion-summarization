Negative Reviews:

Positive Reviews:

---'as development continues, i anticipate great things :)i have had absolutely no problems with this phone whatsoeveri have had only a good experienceeven though i feel that the g2 has a much better "feel" in my hand with it\'s amazing sony super lcd screen, hefty construction and hardware keyboard,  the sensation is just that: sensational.' **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---"the battery lasts a whole day, 4g works wonderfully, the 1.2ghz processor doesn't have 1 second of lag, the screen is much better than the iphone 4's retina display in my opinion *don't hate me all you apple fan-boys* its got the best camera i've seen on a cellphone, and its quite comparable to my canon eos rebel xs." **** 'much'

__________('device',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i never had this much of problems with any other electronic device in my entire life.their customer service is awful too.' **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"this is the phone i wanted, and i would have gave this product 5 stars if it came like i wanted.the shipping was fast, within a week fedex calls and tell me that a package will be at my house the next morning, and that i need to sign it.about the phone, its great, fast, cheap, and one of the first phones of this new generation phones, therefore it will last long before i will need to replace, perfect buy for someone like me that isnt intrested in a contract, still getting used to cause i used iphone for the past 4 years.the phone also came with 8 gb class 4 (kingston) memory card, which i did see in other sites but not on this page, so i bought 16 gb mc just in case, so its great.now if you are looking for an unlocked device, this is not.its t mobile's htc and it even comes in their box and has the logo under the glass,above the screen and ofcourse tmobiles rom.the phone isnt unlocked, works only for tmobile, when you insert another sim it asks you to enter a password which the seller did not provide, after a long frustrating week with many calls, i was lucky enough and got t mobile to unlock it for me, because my friend is on t mobile.if you buy this phone you probably need it unlocked cause otherwise you would have bought it with a cotract from a network, or even live in another country and bought it cause it is cheaper on amazon.the seller did not contact me back so far, all through i managed to get it unlocked, if he will answer back i might change the review, but just letting you know, this is not unlocked, and if you are not on t mobile or have a way to unlock it, its a brick, might as well use at as a door stop." **** 'unlocked'
---"if they don't mind a little set-up & confusion in the beginning, they'll be rewarded with a much more personalized, high-tech & customizable device than the iphone." **** 'much'

__________('speaker',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"the only problem i have with it is its low speaker.the sensation has a very low speaker, you can hardly hear the phone ringing if you're not in a silence environment let alone hear an sms or any other notification.this really bothers me because i like to talk on the speaker a lot and usually i'm not standing right next to my phone so i miss a lot of notifications.other than that, this phone rocks." **** 'low'
---'the speaker is a little soft but i kind of like that now.' **** 'like'

---'the htc sensation is a quality product overflowing, is very attractive and soft to the touch, is a first-generation dual core that does not disappoint anyone, is a well done, well done and a good price.if this penssando buy it, do it, unless you are hesitating between this and the htc evo 3d, then the question is whether you want 3d or not, the bad, the evo 3d is not its thickness, not its weight, is that once you like the 3d of your screen you can not have another phone, so you better buy this.it is also important for those who like the root phone, this is one of the best for these purposes, has exelentes roms and overclocking can reach 1.7ghz without jeopardizing the phone and with a lot of stability and fluidity of last phone if you want a top quality phone, beautiful, flexible and with many options in the world root, order it right now!' **** 'attractive'
