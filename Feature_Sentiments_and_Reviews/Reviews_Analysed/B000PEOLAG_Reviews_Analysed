---'if you are in a plane under terrorist attack and you try to switch it on, the ridiculous opening tune will make sure you will be the first to be killed (i tried to disconnect this tune on the settings - just gave up).speaking of planes, the whole thing is completely useless there - not being able to switch off only the phone, you have to switch it off altogether.- do you just want a mobile phone?' **** 'whole'
---'the only bad thing about the phone and the reason i gave a 4 out of 5 stars is that the battery is weak.' **** 'bad'
---"i find myself using google map (for mobile) more often than this feature.design - it is passable, but certainly does not look like a $700 cell phone (since it won't attract others, is this a good thing?)" **** 'good'

__________('works', 'great')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"my first died after 2 solid years travelling--wrapped tight into a ball ad shoved into luggage day in and out... bought either a fake (said nokia but came from china--my nokia one from finland--and didn't stay attached, fell out and needed to be in a weird specific position)... got a last minute desperate off brand that went a whole month... stick with nokia sealed packages... you will save $$ and they won't necessarily be around forever if nokia happens to change charging methods which i hope they do not... the tiny travel one is the best btw... i had all 3 legit kinds and it rocked.an extra battery isn't a bad idea, though i am still on battery one and it can take a whole 30 hours of talk, text, and radio but only 3-5 hours tops of video via wifi... or a few of camera use...the camera is wonderful... use the landscape behind glass to take tourist shots, the macro with flash off for intense details, and auto with no flash for most... night (no flash) works well if you are super still but it is still not a hd canon, though i prefer it to powershot a-series cams by far and definitely like it more than sanyo/samsung/(eep)kodak(haha)/most small cams... video ispretty good in well lit places, but not so awesome if it is dark (though motion is still awesome--my cat attacking toys and wrestling, pouncing, etc is really clear, and fireworks look awesome on it--the contrast and speed are great so that is the night video exception... any light-against-dark actually does work if stationary).the swapping of cards is essential for me." **** 'super'

Negative Reviews:

---"and if you get in a car and start moving or are walking in a big city (i.e., where you might actually need the gps), it has a really hard time tracking you;- battery life is good for 1-2 days depending on use;- it's not a very convenient size;- camera, though 5mp, takes pretty unimpressive pictures under most lighting conditions;- enormous price tag.i probably would not buy this phone again, but mostly on account of the gps functionality." **** 'hard'

Positive Reviews:

---"i had to buy an extra charger for work and for the car.i text regularly - but find i've got to do more key presses to initiate a text than i did on my old phone - only a small point but slightly annoying.the gps is fustrating - it's nice that you can get maps from anywhere in the world - but you do have to remeber to download them via the wifi before you go anywhere because here in nz the network charges are to high ($10/mb from vodafone!!!)" **** 'extra'
