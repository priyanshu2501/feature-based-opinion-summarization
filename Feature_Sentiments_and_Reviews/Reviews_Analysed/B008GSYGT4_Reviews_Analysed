Positive Reviews:

---'easy to use keyboard, so much better then all the others i have used.' **** 'easy'
---"obviously if you just switched from a fancy dancy smart phone, it's probably going to take some time to adjust to this new keyboard." **** 'new'
---"i would agree with a lot of the other reviews that the keyboard is pretty small, but i have small fingers, so it's not as big of a problem for me." **** 'small'
---'very happy with the phone except the keyboard is kind of small.' **** 'kind'
---'the keyboard is nice and a little small but it works.' **** 'nice'
---'this was an upgrade for an easier keyboard and perhaps being able to use it via wifi.' **** 'easier'
---'this was an upgrade for an easier keyboard and perhaps being able to use it via wifi.' **** 'able'
---"i like this phone a lot and i'm glad i bought it, the keyboard is easy to use and the alarm clock feature is convenient.i read reviews on about six phones and decided on this one.i got it on sale for $19.99 and free shipping.i would recommend it." **** 'easy'
---'my criteria for a phone included a camera (still and video), web access, full querty keyboard, easy to use/program, voice commands, well built, all the other bells & whistles (wi-fi & bluetooth, mp3, voice activated and easy apps) and reasonably priced.' **** 'easy'
---'the system is laughably called "nuance".if this voice dialing nightmare weren\'t enough of a deal-breaker, there are a number of other "features" i could do without:1) as others have noted, the cramped keyboard makes it really easy to insert periods into sentences when texting.' **** 'cramped'
---"the call quality seems better than with my last phone (an lg fliphone) especially from cell to cell even when i don't have full bars.so in short this phone has many little problems, but on the upside it is cheap, handsome, has wifi, a full keyboard, triple minutes and many other features.update: so i've been using this phone for about two weeks now or so, and i am noticing some major problems.first of all i tried reactivating my old lg phone with a new phone number for my dad to use." **** 'other'
---"the qwerty keyboard takes some getting used to but it doesn't take long." **** 'long'
---'call clarity is excellent and the qwerty keyboard makes texting very easy.' **** 'easy'

---'so, the thumb keyboard is nice to have for writing text messages.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---'the keyboard is more complicated to use than i was expecting.' **** 'complicated'
---'very happy with the phone except the keyboard is kind of small.' **** 'small'
---"this review gives one star, since zero is not an option, for both the phone and the provider - tracfone.pros: nice screen, really nice keyboard for texting and entering data.cons: camera is horrible - may as well not be there at all for indoor pix, tho i haven't tried in bright natural light." **** 'nice'
---'the keyboard is nice and a little small but it works.' **** 'small'
---"i would imagine there's a google calendar app that may work on it's own with wifi connection...?my only complaints are:the browser connection is on the front screen, so you do have to be careful not to connect to the browser if you haven't connected to wifi yet.it would be real nice if the keyboard was a slide-out so that the actual screen size would be larger.have to add contacts manually.for this price (less than $8.00 a month on the year plan on a triple minute deal), the benefits, and functionality are great.10/3/13 have to add that tracfone customer service is wonderful." **** 'nice'
---'so, i selected the s390g because it has a keyboard and was inexpensive.' **** 'inexpensive'
---"the built in speaker is nothing to brag about but at least there's a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.the 2.0 camera/camcorder takes grainy photos but that's to be expected and one must be very still using the camcorder.the wifi set up is fast and user friendly as well as the bluetooth which i was able to pair with my car audio system in no time.the screen is low rez but easy on the eyes, the qwerty keyboard is responsive, yet some may find the keys to be on the small side?now i do have a complaint and that is porting my number was a pain between my two back pockets!" **** 'responsive'
---"if you do a lot of texting but don't need the processing power of a smartphone, this might be a good choice for you--except for its tragic flaws.although it looks kind of like a smartphone, it's really just an ordinary candy bar phone with a better keyboard, and the ability to hook to wifi so you don't burn your minutes browsing the web over its pitiful built-in browser." **** 'better'
---'if you punch 000 or 112 or perhaps some other keyboard combinations, even through lock, it will ask you if you want to dial 911. and if you then mash the enter key, it will dial it.' **** 'other'

---'there are two triggers under the space bar so that it will work if pushed on either end, the defect with this is that if you push too close to the center it sets off both triggers causing a double space which on this phone causes a period with a space, supposed to be convenient but is more of a pain actually.' **** 'double'

---"it always adds a period and a space unless you press the left edge of the space bar, and that's difficult because the space bar is pretty small.the lg 540 is a tracfone with a much more blackberry-like keyboard, but it's more expensive.instead of a 4-way directional button to navigate through the menus, it has a cute little track pad sensor." **** 'difficult'
