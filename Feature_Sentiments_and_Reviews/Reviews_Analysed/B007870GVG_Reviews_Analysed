Negative Reviews:

---"the phone is nice, good audio, big screen.a protective cover makes it a little difficult to operate (it is necessary to press the side keys really hard), but it is necessary since the screen is too big and a phone drop may cause the display to crack (i've seen this before).the issue i had was that after the phone had its sim card, it prompted to upgrade to android version 4.2.1 (official upgrade from google)." **** 'necessary'
---'i like the form factor (if this phone feels "plasticky," i like plasticky), i like the amoled display, a month into owning my gnex, however slightly, i scratched the screen (less than 1mm long).' **** 'less'
---"it's very light and the screen is just the right size for browsing the internet." **** 'light'
