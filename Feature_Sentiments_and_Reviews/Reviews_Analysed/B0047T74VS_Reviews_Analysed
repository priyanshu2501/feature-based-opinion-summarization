---'many of the early adopters of the new windows phone 7 (wp7) are interested in the first mobile xbox live (xbl) platform inside the new os.' **** 'new'
---'best windows phone 7 handset on the market.i only gave 4 stars because the case is a bit cheap (all plastic) and there are some missing features (cut & paste arrives this month, but still no visual voice mail).' **** 'best'
---'i am not sure if the focus is worse than the other windows 7 phones, or not, so this may just be a windows 7 thing, not samsung.3.' **** 'other'
---'to put it plainly i hated windows mobile 6.0 and 6.5, although the htc overlay made it usable but still clunky and slow.with that being said when it came time for me to decide on an android phone with either an htc overlay or the motorola overlay (called motoblur) or an iphone 4... i was just about to buy one when my friend showed me his new windows phone 7 samsung focus.' **** 'new'
---"that was the past 10 years, but times, they are a changing... the samsung focus has taken the boring windows mobile interface, replaced it with the all new windows phone os and turned a boring mobile smartphone into a serious player that all of a sudden may very well be the life of the party.i was lucky enough to get my hands on a samsung focus early on, and i have to say that i've had a very hard time putting this phone down." **** 'new'
---'as soon as i saw the new windows phone i was blown away.' **** 'new'
---'i recently bought the focus with winphone 7.  i am very picky about smartphone technology, but i have to tell you that microsoft has done an incredible job with windows phone 7.  other than the clunky name of "windows phone 7", there is nothing clunky about this smartphone operating system.' **** 'other'

---'the focus was the best of the new windows phones in terms of screen, battery size and memory expansion.let me tell you, i have not regretted purchasing the phone for a second.' **** 'new'
---'if you currently own an at&t; phone with 3g capability, the focus will likely achieve the same results.what will make or break the focus for most users is windows phone 7.  it is a simple, visually attractive smartphone operating system that is much more user friendly than the former windows mobile 6 series.' **** 'former'
---'compared to other phones like the htcs, this feature alone makes it stand out as the top windows 7 phone currently available.' **** 'top'
---'most apps available on the iphone/android are either unavailable or very primitive on the windows platform.' **** 'unavailable'
---"bricking phones that attempted to update is as much microsoft's fault as samsung's, so there is mud on both of their faces; however, the application market continues to grow, more features are scheduled for later this year in a major update (including multitasking), and the integration with other windows products is fantastic.bottom line, this is a great phone if you want a digital dashboard." **** 'other'
---"i've owned several windows mobile phones, so it came as quite a shock to me to find that the new windows phone 7 doesn't sync with outlook." **** 'new'
---'this is because in the new windows phone os the microsd is not removable -- it actually becomes part of the overall system memory and is a permanent addition to the phone (which is why its located behind the battery).' **** 'new'
---"it's not a huge problem but worth mentioning.so, if you are in the market for a smartphone - don't buy one til you at least give windows phone 7 a try." **** 'give'

---'the apps available for this phone so far are good and are not as expensive as some people seem to be suggesting, a lot of things you would use on a daily basis are free or only cost $0.99the os itself is so sleek and smooth, very easy to navigate compared to any other phone i have owned which includes bberry, nokia and windows mobile 6. you cannot beat the looks on this phone and from all i have learned it seems microsoft is going to be providing a good level of support for it as well as maintaining control over the quality of the experience using the phone (which apps you can install and how they affect usage) which in my opinion is a good thing all be it perhaps a little heavy handed to begin with.battery life is better than i thought (i am not a heavy email/corporate user) mainly calls, texting, surfing over wifi and the big one mp3 playback via zune.' **** 'good'

Positive Reviews:

---'i highly recommend you pop in a 32gb card to give you a 40gb phone out of the box -- it will let you really put the phone to use storing your media and other data while not having to worry about it down the road.next, get ready to be connected to your family, friends and social networks like never before.' **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"many apps that support live tiles hangs a lot and keep stale data that sometimes are more than a day old, which in both cases render the feature useless and even worse than iphone, cause you sometimes depend on data and find later (when it's too late) that this data is 1 day old.2- app store can't be compared at all with neither apple appstore or android." **** 'stale'

---"* the media player - i really like the zune software built in, and it is more like ipod/iphone devices in that it will play most any formats i throw at it, not nearly as picky as the android media players were* live tiles - very slick implementation* the home/lock screen - i like the way that all the updates you need are delivered right there* carriers/oem have limited pre-installed junkware - one thing i never understood was why someone would want to make a nascar app uninstallable on a smartphone (sprint/htc, i'm talking to you)." **** 'slick'
---"now after being with the phone for more than 5 months, i can say what i liked and what i didn't.what i liked:1- fresh ui experience.2- email & office experience are both much better than those in iphone (which doesn't have office).3- live tiles is a very nice idea but it was executed in a very bad way (see what i didn't like section)4- screen brightness is amazing (although iphone 4 screen was awesome too)5- the phone is light weight and looks good.now what i didn't like (i know it's a very huge list but anyway):1- although the live tiles concept is very good but, it went through bad execution, first of all, i do not see that much application supporting it." **** 'live'

---'not enough free apps.' **** 'free'
---'it is very easy to install and unistall apps from the phone or via the zune software.browsing experience is decent as well.' **** 'easy'
---'i heard about rumors that win7p does not have enough free apps to work, somewhat its true but not fully.' **** 'free'
---"there aren't near the apps that apple has and i understand that it will get there with the apps but apps i had on my iphone for free cost about 4.99 at this marketplace." **** 'near'
---'many basic applications are available on windows marketplace, but the lack of several key apps is puzzling to say the least.' **** 'key'
---'most apps available on the iphone/android are either unavailable or very primitive on the windows platform.' **** 'available'
---"it syncs with xbox live, and has numerous other built it apps and free apps available for addon.here is the best part it's every bit as fast if not faster than the droid phones i've seen, and the iphone; and additionally everything just works." **** 'free'
---'ok im not going to write much but the phone is really good its fast and has a very good camera, the speakers are loud and nice and the display is really good only bad part is that it doesnt have as many free apps as the iphone does and most apps are overpriced like you can get the same app for 99 cents in the itunes app store (of course they wont work on the phone) and in the microsoft marketplace they are 2.99 so a bit of price difference.' **** 'free'
---'the keyboard text input on the wp7 is excellent and on par with iphone.the zune marketplace which has both apps and music, works well and has one feature i love.' **** 'music'
---'i contacted windows phone support via twitter but there was really no explanation except to make sure all third-party apps are closed (none were open).' **** 'sure'
---"i haven't really missed any other apps that i had on other platforms.i bought a 32gb microsd card at at&t; so storage isn't an issue." **** 'other'
---'this is not a major issue but certainly an annoyance.the twitter app is ok but i wish they removed the teal background and just used the default (black or gray) backgrounds that are standard throughout other apps on the phone.' **** 'other'
---'nothing like iphone or android.-the whole os is faster and smoother even more, old installed apps run faster, load even faster.-finally full multitasking!' **** 'load'
---"i like how they show you artist posters automatically and they also have bios,...the keyboard is great especially after a day or two of getting used to it.the phone has only been out for a couple days so everything is perfect but i haven't had any issues and they are getting more and more apps on top of the tons they already had.i think walmart might be selling the phone $50 cheaper than at&t; is." **** 'top'

Negative Reviews:

---'i really do not care much about the apps and games, seriously a phone or a netbook can never substitute the comfort of a laptop/gps.' **** 'much'
---"some of the apps were good, but as a phone, i never thought it was very good.i've since upgraded to the new samsung focus windows phone 7 and i love it." **** 'good'
---'some of the apps are quirky but overall.' **** 'overall'
---"this was the perfect replacement allowing me to only carry one device instead of two and giving me the best of both worlds along with solid but not spectacular camera.note to people complaining about apps: if you are going to write a review based on 3 week old (to market) technology and complain that it doesn't have as good or as many apps as the iphone i suggest you think about what your writing before you write it because you are comparing apples to oranges and really are just hating with no valid information to backup what you are saying." **** 'good'
---'the apps available for this phone so far are good and are not as expensive as some people seem to be suggesting, a lot of things you would use on a daily basis are free or only cost $0.99the os itself is so sleek and smooth, very easy to navigate compared to any other phone i have owned which includes bberry, nokia and windows mobile 6. you cannot beat the looks on this phone and from all i have learned it seems microsoft is going to be providing a good level of support for it as well as maintaining control over the quality of the experience using the phone (which apps you can install and how they affect usage) which in my opinion is a good thing all be it perhaps a little heavy handed to begin with.battery life is better than i thought (i am not a heavy email/corporate user) mainly calls, texting, surfing over wifi and the big one mp3 playback via zune.' **** 'available'
---'ms gives little warning that you must have a microsoft live id or hotmail account to  access marketplace app, even free apps.' **** 'free'
---'i would the option to have contact folders, accessible  by tabs, similar to other apps (email has tabs for all, unread, urgent) it would be so logical to have tabs in the people  hub labeled phone, email1, email2, facebook, etc.' **** 'other'
---'i heard about rumors that win7p does not have enough free apps to work, somewhat its true but not fully.' **** 'true'
---'i do have free apps for fb, google search, youtube, google maps, yelps, netflix, bofa, vevo and many more.' **** 'free'
---'you will definitely find enough free apps to keep you busy.13.' **** 'free'
---'this blew me away.- the device is light, thin and beautiful.- the app store has tons of cool apps, many of which are free.' **** 'free'
---'in particular, smartphone users who need a powerful customizable smartphone and/or who rely on a myriad of apps should either test drive the focus before buying, or take advantage of the trial period.' **** 'myriad'
---"reading all of the microsoft support documentation it sounds as if this is samsung's fault, the microsd slot should not have been user accessable and shouldn't be advertised as such* quantity of apps - no where near the app store, but this just takes time* cost of apps - the apps are too expensive - usually 2x more than apple or google* all of the at&t; apps cost more money - seriously, wtf?" **** 'expensive'
---'some say not enough apps.' **** 'enough'
---"the camera is great for quick capture moments, but no camera phone can replace a normal camera on vacations or nature shots ... yet.samsung's and at&t;'s extra software apps are basically pointless." **** 'pointless'
---"it syncs with xbox live, and has numerous other built it apps and free apps available for addon.here is the best part it's every bit as fast if not faster than the droid phones i've seen, and the iphone; and additionally everything just works." **** 'available'
---"no, it doesn't have as many apps as the iphone (although there are plenty of apps available already, and more will come with time)." **** 'available'
---"i think the ear volume could be a bit louder.i am not into all the apps at this time, though i find it hard to believe that an os that has 200,000 apps available is a better deal that another that has 40,000. how can you possibly have so much free time as to flow through all that sw and choose the 'just right' ones for you?" **** 'available'
---"i got one for my wife too who is very technically unaware and she loves it.- the amoled screen from samsung is simply gorgeous, i've yet to see better on any phone.cons.- despite the fact there are many choices of hardware and you can select a better windows phone the picture quality could be better.- as a samsung focus, despite the fact it looks sleeker and cooler than a iphone, it will take some skills to convince your friends you have a better phone.- there is a lack of professional apps such as zagat but these are in the works and in 3 months most professional apps will be available since this phone has been on the market for about three months.overall, i am convinced i've come out of a brainwashing experience and been open minded to try this phone out, since screen clarity was important and a new user experience was important and music was important and i have not regrets in my purchase of the samsung focus." **** 'professional'
