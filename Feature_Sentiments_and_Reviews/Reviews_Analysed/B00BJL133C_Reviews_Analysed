---"in this case, the htc one comes with the brand new sense with blinkfeed built on top of the somewhat dated android 4.1.2.  blinkfeed has taken over the much admired htc clock/weather widget of old and replaced it with a feed that aggregates your preferred news from various media outlets, your social media feeds from things like facebook and twitter, and even what's on tv (more on that later)." **** 'much'

---'your phone constantly searching for 3g and/or a wifi signal is a huge battery drain, so make sure you cut wifi off when not in use.htc has done a great job improving battery life with their updated sense 5.  my original htc evo 4g had horrible battery life and could barely go 4 hrs before the phone would die.' **** 'original'
---"i believe the reason for this is since the battery is not replaceable htc wants to make sure the device will last for many many years, because if the battery should go out like some previous ones made by htc this phone is not repairable because of the sealed aluminum body and they will pretty much have to send you a new device which could get pretty expensive.from what i've been told and read it takes about 3 hours to get to around 90% and the last 10% takes the additional hr to get to a full charge, but like i stated earlier, i typically don't have to plug my phone in till i'm ready for bed, so this has not been an issue for me.camera:as i stated in the specs above, htc decided to avoid the mega pixel war and shake some things up and went with a 4mp." **** 'replaceable'

---'a lot of the apps that are available for both android and ios seem to lag behind on new feature updates and lack the same attention to detail in the android app market.the real killer though, is that unlocking the bootloader to flash new recovery and rom images voids your warranty.' **** 'available'
---'more elegant and straight forward, better customer support, better apps, and more reliable.' **** 'reliable'
---'you can even configure it at "htc start"  so you can put all your info and apps you want first, before it arrives to your hands.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'the speakers sound terrible, the screen has obvious issues, there is a dead sport on the touch screen, the screen goes blank from time to time for no reason, and some of my apps even just disappear from my phone with no warning.' **** 'disappear'
---'my first android phone.harder to set up than the iphone, but once done (allow about 4-6 hours to transfer files and download the requisite apps), it works about as easily.' **** 'requisite'
---"the recent apps multitasking only allows for the last 9 applications, comes shipped with 4.1 and i'm not sure when we'll get android 4.2, hopefully soon." **** 'recent'
---"for example you can't just directly add one of the apps on the homescreen to the lockscreen shortcut, you have to drag it from the app drawer to the lockscreen." **** 'add'
---"the phone itself is also pretty glitchy - a lot of apps aren't able to match the interface which results in a lot of app crashing." **** 'able'
---'or you have to get other similar apps (try nils notification screen with widget locker).' **** 'similar'
---"so be aware that buying a samsung may very well mean that your favorite apps, which work perfectly on other manufacturer's devices, won't act the same on a samsung." **** 'favorite'

---'also 32gb is enough for installing 3-4 larges games with 5-6 movies too, along with many small apps, pictures, documents, etc.to get an idea of the battery life, my htc one battery went from 100% to 10% in 4-5 hours.' **** 'small'
