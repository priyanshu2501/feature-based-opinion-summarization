---"in fact i would personally cancel my spotify but my gf loves it so she uses it on her iphone.one last thing, i use this phone on a month to month contract with straight talk with an at-t sim card and it works almost as well as my verizon service and i live in a remote mountainous area, so i would recommend that service as well.anyhow, more later, but so far i don't anticipate using another phone for a very long time." **** 'long'
---"i bought this phone in june 2013. today, one year later, i have experienced good and bad things - unfortunately there are more cons than pros, so i did not recommend lg to my mum and dad, who just bought motorola moto g (i'll soon review it, but seems much better than my nexus 4, even with a smaller configuration), and neither will i buy my next phone lg.i don't use the phone for gaming or any other heavy use, i just use it to read emails, view some pdf and ms word and ms excel files, navigate on the internet and facebook, take some pictures and use some comm apps like whatsapp, skype and viber.prosgreat screen and definitiongood processor, fast navigationused with a ringke cover and screen film (awesome products), my phone has no scratches at all after 1 year of useeasy to navigate and configurateconssometimes restarts the phone for no reason at allsometimes freezes or blackens the screen for no reason at all, takes a long time to respond againwhen multi tasking during a phone call, it is hard to go back to the phone screencan't use skype, although i updated every android version - it just doesn't do video calls, it always boots the phonebattery goes away too fast, it got better after i installed an app to manage it (i used du battery saver and it works good, doubled battery lifetime)bad cameras, the frontal is the worst camera i have ever used, and the back camera makes granulated images even in clear daylight, colors are fade in any lighting conditiondoesn't switch between wifi and mobile connection automatically (when you're in wifi range, it doesn't turn 3g off), couldn't find a satisfying app to do that for medoesn't shrink picture sizes automatically when emailing them (iphone does that smoothly)i just can't connect it via usb to a pc, it developped a faulty connection in the phone plug where the input cable plug fits, though it still works normally to charge the battery.hope the newer nexus versions fixed all these, but i won't buy another lg so soon to find out by myself..." **** 'long'
---"also, this review will be long and somewhat incoherent, but i'll try my best to cover as much as i can about this phone.a little bit of information about me, i am a computer hobbyist whose first venture into the realm of smart phones is the nexus 4.  yes, it's been a long time coming, but i've never felt compelled to join the ranks of mobile tech enthusiasts until now, and the reason boils mainly down to the fact that the nexus 4 is, at least in my opinion, the best bang for the buck you can get within the vast selection of android smartphones out there.the hardware, even now, is still top of the line when it comes to the combination of processor, gpu, and the 2gb ram." **** 'long'

---'firstly i must confess that i come from a long line of apples: iphone 2 and 4, ipad, ipad mini, imac and macbook air, just so you have it in perspective.i bought this phone because i wanted to try the android os and being a big fan of google this had to be the one, it was intended as a replacement for an iphone 5 that i ejected because i found it second rate.the nexus 4 is a very cool phone, very fast, very nice looking, feels very good, very easy to operate and the display is incredibly good, overall i like it very much and in some respects is better than the ios platform in iphone: the widgets with info cards that you can insert in some of the screens; some applications can interact seamlessly with the nexus, thus you can send pics to whatsapp directly from the camera application; and the swipe down general status display is really cool and helpful.on the other hand, some procedures seem to take more steps in nexus that on my iphone, i have to click around more to get some things done; my contact list is not as good as the one on my iphone, it always seems to be inaccurate or incomplete despite the fact that i imported my iphone address book; and my schedule is easier to keep across my devices in ical.regarding the hardware, the nexus is too sleek and buttonless if you pick it up without looking its hard to tell which side is up, down, front or back so you wind up picking it in the wrong position and having to look at it; the power button and the volume button are on the sides exactly opposite to each other so often when you press one, you wind up pressing the other, specially if you are not looking, these are mayor ergonomic oversights.' **** 'second'

---'"feels" more solidgoogle wallet is fully supported.batter life is well over double what the battery life of the galaxy nexus is on 4g lte.brings us to the disadvantages:batter is not user replaceable.personally, i think the galaxy nexus with it\'s amoled display has a slight advantage in contrast and color saturation.over-all, i\'m very happy with the nexus 4 and can highly recommend it.' **** 'happy'
---'i never "downloaded" an "app" until now, but it is so easy, like falling off a log.i have created a google list of people by uploading my outlook contact list to the google website, and instantly, all the contacts are available in the new nexus 4.  incidentally, i\'ve had the nexus 4 for about a week now.i\'ve answered email, placed stock buys, sent sms txt messages, bought stuff on amazon, and generally had a really fun time with this phone!you will have to have some patience dealing with google play store.' **** 'new'

---"nexus 4 however doesn't need all this and as soon as the update is out from google it can be installed without any modificationsprice: the price of the stock device from google is 350$ which is way less then any other device of similar specs and size.the bad:price: yes i have included the price in the good section but i am also including this in the bad section because as you can see you are not paying the stock price for this on amazon but over 500$ which is a lot.strange noise issue: there have been cases(not with me) of buzzing noise coming from the phones earpiece in the earlier models but seems to be fixed in the newer ones, so be careful before you get one.lte: there is not lte capability on this device so if you use lte you should try looking at the iphone 5 or the galaxy s iii.lack of microsd: there is not space for e micro sd card so you cannot add more storage space and are pretty much stuck with the storage space you buy." **** 'google'

---"unless lte is important, or you know that 16 gb is just not enough storage, i cannot recommend this device any more heartily.update: looking back after 2 months of use, without a doubt, this was a great purchase.it is well performing device, and does it so effortlessly that i no longer even notice how well it performs, until i use another phone as a comparison point.the size of the device no longer bothers me - after spending some time with it, i can now comfortably use it one-handed, and do so 90% of the time.the power button issue also has gone away as i've gotten used to its location and how best to reach it while holding the phone one-handed.up until last week, the battery life was still nothing to talk about, but the recent update to 4.2.2 seems to have changed that in a very positive way." **** 'recent'

---"update march, 2014:the fact that it doesn't have a sd slot made it unusable after a while with no memory for new apps, pics, videos, mp3, etc (although trying to follow google trend towards online services).and i'm relieved now that i went back to a samsung galaxy note phone with 64gb sd card (and amazing battery life).moving the files from nexus to the sd card/galaxy was such a pain, that i will never go back to a phone with no sd card (hope future nexus include it since in the os department are the best, but unusable for other ala apple/ios/iphone limitations like the non existent sd card nonsense.previous upgrades between samsung galaxy phones was such a breeze... just had to change the sd and had all my mp3 collection, photos (i'm a photographer), videos, etcupdate december 16, 2013:i bought 2 phones three months ago (september 2013), and one of them is new completely dead and bricked." **** 'new'

Positive Reviews:

---"so i've bought theanker astro 5600mah backup external battery pack high capacity charger, to carry when i'm going to be away from power outlets for long days, which isn't unusual." **** 'unusual'
---'everything worked perfectly... the only bad thing is that it took a couple of extra days to get here.' **** 'extra'
---"last, the speed, it's not that fast, scrolling is clumsy, didn't get to play a game on it, but the overall ui doesn't perform well in my opinion.i know it's a &#34;nexus&#34; and it's supposed to be the best, well, i don't think it is, i returned mine after 4 days of use, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone." **** 'mine'

Negative Reviews:

__________('nexus', '4', 'has')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'i bought used phone in us.the condition this phone is good but a little expensive.before using this phone, i used nexus.nexus 4 which is next version of nexus has better specifications.screen recognizing is much smoother and faster.and the design is more attractive.camera,, there is no more benefit than nexus.but google phone is very efficient phone to use properly.' **** 'better'
---"having owned the original nexus one since the week of it's release, i sort of expected better durability with the nexus 4. granted, the one was made by htc and the four by lg but still, somehow my nexus one has survived tremendous abuse over the past three years while i was pretty careful with the shiny new nexus 4.  perhaps the problem is the over hyped gorilla glass." **** 'original'
---'i purchased my google nexus 4 16gb - unlocked from t-mobile for a considerable savings.' **** 'unlocked'
---'i am very happy with my purchase.google nexus 4 phone 16gb - unlocked' **** 'happy'
---"i've had a galaxy nexus, and, even though it receives the updates, buying the nexus 4 was totally worth it.finally android has reached a stage where the navigation is fluid, smooth, and you experience almost no bugs at all time.4.2.2 jelly bean, and now 4.3, are the best os' google has ever made." **** 'worth'
---"i hope google has a fix soon, it can be a source of potential embarrassment when it hits as you are trying to show it off to the iphone cult!some other points which i've noticed which are plus points for the nexus 4:a) wireless charging support; no official charger is out there yet, but some models which support the nexus 4 exist." **** 'google'
---"that, believe it or not, still leaves me almost two thirds of the on-phone storage available!if i were going to buy another phone right now, i wouldn't bother considering anything but a google nexus 4 which has enhanced my life way beyond any expectations i had going in.oh yeah." **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---'i am happy to own nexus 4 smartphone and i bought it at a higher price than available at google just because it was out of stock on google and i just dont want to wait.it is a amazing phone with sleek design (better than galaxy s3), powerful quad core processor and 2 gb ram which is the main reason for me to buy because i had samsung galaxy earlier which was awefully slow.with nexus you dont have to worry about speed and also since it has clean untampered android os which can automatically update before any other brand android phone can.' **** 'happy'
---'"feels" more solidgoogle wallet is fully supported.batter life is well over double what the battery life of the galaxy nexus is on 4g lte.brings us to the disadvantages:batter is not user replaceable.personally, i think the galaxy nexus with it\'s amoled display has a slight advantage in contrast and color saturation.over-all, i\'m very happy with the nexus 4 and can highly recommend it.' **** 'happy'

__________('bang', 'for', 'buck')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the phone itself is a 9. now compared to newer ones down to an 8. but the price bumps it up to an 8.5. the most bang for the buck by a long shot.' **** 'bang'
---'i considered both android and i-phones before buying and decided that, since i know the android os and apps, this was the best bang for the buck.' **** 'best'

Negative Reviews:

---"best bang for the buck when coming to android phones... you simply can't get a better deal than a nexus... the only downside is that the screen is worse than samsung's and htc (but that's to be expected given the price difference)" **** 'best'
---'the guy who said it may not be the best phone, but the best bang for your buck has it right.sure, the specs on the pixel density & screen resolution are slightly worse than the other top phones out there (although barely if at all noticeable to the naked eye).' **** 'best'
---"also, this review will be long and somewhat incoherent, but i'll try my best to cover as much as i can about this phone.a little bit of information about me, i am a computer hobbyist whose first venture into the realm of smart phones is the nexus 4.  yes, it's been a long time coming, but i've never felt compelled to join the ranks of mobile tech enthusiasts until now, and the reason boils mainly down to the fact that the nexus 4 is, at least in my opinion, the best bang for the buck you can get within the vast selection of android smartphones out there.the hardware, even now, is still top of the line when it comes to the combination of processor, gpu, and the 2gb ram." **** 'best'
---'for those that can afford it and want near-seamless access to the internet through their wireless phone service, it might affect their decision to opt with this phone or another one that has fcc licensing for general consumer use of 4g lte.overall, i think the nexus 4, despite its caveats, is the best bang for the buck as far as android phones are concerned.' **** 'best'
