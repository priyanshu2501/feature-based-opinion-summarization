---'pictures compress in quality and look harsher than original when you send or recieve them.-battery life is not bad but can be better.-keypad is a too flat and keys are indistinct.-screen layout has annoying t-mobile logo-wallpapers are ugly!' **** 'original'
---'the picture quality is dreadfully poor... no individual ringtone can be given to each number but has a group ringtone option ( which is sick to have... no individual option but a group option... "r u using ur brains samsung engineers....").. no option of saving the pictures to the simcard...( it was painful to lose all my 100 odd pics when i had to return my phone for exchange and i lost interest in taking pics anymore after i got the exchange phone).' **** 'poor'
---'even sprint a600 has good quality pictures.i know for most of us picture quality of camera is not as important as having a camera but for me it makes a difference.can somebody help me on deciding the phone.thanks for ur help.' **** 'good'
