---'while a bit over priced, it works well.off topic: i have been using my android tablet a lot less since the phone arrived.most of the negative reviews obviously have nothing to do with the phone.' **** 'negative'
---'i normally do not give reviews:  positive or negative.' **** 'negative'
---"there are alot of good reviews here, so i'll give my own observations in short style.~ 4g coverage is spotty in my area and the network switching can cause hang ups (according to verizon)." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"the smart action app is needed especially if you want to make the battery last.-i've also been reading a lot of negative reviews of motorola skin....to be honest i thought it was gonna be bad but when i got some hands on time, it's actually fitting and i do like it." **** 'negative'
---"so far the negative reviews for this phone are based off of what amazon is charging for it ($249 for upgrade customers, $111 for new customers)...the phone is $300 in verizon and $300 with a ton of accessories over at costco today.now, as for the actual phone itself...it's good." **** 'negative'
---"it slows the device down a little bit but provides their own custom interface that creates a more flashy transition between apps, screens, etc.also motorola's razr has kevlar on the back for strength, a nano-coating on the outside and inside for splash protection, and gorilla glass 2.0 for the screen...this might be the first legit droid where no case is required.call quality from mobiletechreview, phonedog, cnet, and others all say this phone is excellent, as is the smoothness of the web browser and the gps.the only negative is that the battery isn't removable so the battery in the phone is all you get...what that means for me is nothing though since i have a car charger and charger at the office, not to mention the docking station doubles as one and looks good on my desk.for anyone who's been a fan of motorola's old razr, their new droids, or just needs a new phone, this is the best one that's out there right now...yes better than the iphone, especially if you like to customize things...nothing competes with android in that regard.the camera and the videocamera so far got good reviews as well, with the camera side of it getting higher marks, especially when showing off the videos to your friends on the big screen.cloud service is standard as well as a smart actions app that can customize how the phone works everywhere you go...for instance it uses gps to detect when you're at work, connecting you to the wi-fi there, making your phone ringer change to vibrate on days when u have a meeting, etc..it's a really cool idea.finally through motorola you can sync your pc to the phone and transfer data instantly...take a note in word for class, the note appears in word back on your dorm laptop, want to listen to your itunes, music can be streamed from your pc's playlist without you having to actually put the songs on your phone.it's a great device and everyone who's negative about it just for the price is really stupid...either get it now for $249 like the sad sad people paid 2 months ago for the bionic, like people did for the thunderbolt, and like people did for the revolution....or wait till black friday and/or christmas when i'm sure some sort of sale will be happening...either way it's a good phone." **** 'good'
---'to be honest verizon is the worst place to buy from but since i could charge it on my bill and i am almost 6 months away from when my contract is up it was the only option.as from what i read in other reviews yes the phone has black blotches.' **** 'other'
---'i normally do not give reviews:  positive or negative.' **** 'positive'
---"my contract is up and with all the negative reviews of phones out there, i'm hesitant to switch even with the slowness." **** 'negative'
---'for those who want to know more, i suggest you look at some of the other reviews here by those who use it often.conclusion...when the razr upgrades to ice cream sandwich, i would dare say that in all areas save the screen resolution only, this will be the equal of the galaxy nexus.' **** 'other'
---'although the bad reviews about the battery life scared the heck out of me i took the plunge and bought it anyway.' **** 'bad'
---"if you want to read all about the doe-eyed, fawning reviews about this phone, you'll need to bring up the other reviews." **** 'other'
---"again, this is a non-techy review by someone who just wanted a solid device, and according to other reviews on this site, and many other sites, the razr's a pretty good phone.i had been waiting and drooling over the release of the galaxy nexus, but the razr has a good gorilla glass screen, a better camera, hdmi and assisted gps, kevlar back and is water resistant when comparing to the samsung galaxy nexus." **** 'other'
---"first, for those of you who feel that those reviews that complain about the pricing don't belong amongst other device reviews or that those users, who felt passionate enough to express their feelings, should stop their whining, i'd like you to take a step back and re-think what you said." **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'i used to have an iphone and i thought the battery life was bad, until i switched to the razr.' **** 'bad'
---"but then, i use google chrome, so google already tracks and saves what i search on and what web sites i visit, so they may as well know who i'm calling, and when, and for how long...  other than that, i'm impressed wth its hot spot capability, te fact that when it's on my home wifi it does not appear to bill me for megabytes delivered, and even its battery life has been good." **** 'good'

---'also wanted to add that the battery does have a short life when using the phone heavily!' **** 'short'
---'first, the battery has been criticized, not only for its lifespan, but its inaccessibility.' **** 'first'
---"not playing games all day, but you're working your job or learning in class which in theory means you're using it maybe 2 or so hours a day) can help in reaching the lauded battery life levels.again though, since it's an inaccessible battery, you'll need to be near a charger or carry an external battery pack, such asmotorola universal dual-charging portable power pack (black, retail packaging)or something larger if you need more power than this puts out." **** 'inaccessible'

---"i'd like to switch carriers in protest but i have to admit that verizon is the highest quality service by a large margin." **** 'highest'
---"rough estimate is it will last about 3 hours with normal use, and that's with 1780 mahr.-power button is placed awkwardly, and is nearly flush with the phone, but the saving grace is that it has a distinctive ridged feel that can be used to find it by running a finger along the edge.even with these drawbacks, still like it better than other current android phones, e.g., rate it over the gsii for 540 vs 480 pixel screen resolution and higher quality materials and overall better design.but please, put a decent 720 pixel screen in the next razr." **** 'higher'
---'that gives google one month to work out any bugs on ics when it comes out.pros:- temporarily the price!- like the design all around, best out there so far (kevlar feels smooth and adds a great aesthectic look, quality construction throughout).- smart actions app is working out as intended and very intuitive.- motorola music app (same opinion as above)- the display/screen is bigger than most, and the quality it puts out is an 8 out of 10 (rather give it a score), not as good as an iphone 4s/htc rezound (9 out of 10).- call quality is clear and havent had a dropped call yet, full bars or less 1 everywhere i go.- speaker is loud, although it gets fuzzy if cranked up to the max (no issues with the phone jack and music sounds great).- 4glte is crazy fast, no issues with connection.cons:- the price when it goes back up.- battery would last the day but down to 10% and i would consider myself a medium user.' **** 'bigger'

Positive Reviews:

---'like many, i was interested in the $111.11 price from amazon wireless, especially since i have four phones that are ready to be upgraded, but i was informed by the verizon rep. that it is only available to new verizon customers and that i would lose my existing cell phone numbers if i dropped my existing accounts in order to become a "new" customer.' **** 'interested'
---"it slows the device down a little bit but provides their own custom interface that creates a more flashy transition between apps, screens, etc.also motorola's razr has kevlar on the back for strength, a nano-coating on the outside and inside for splash protection, and gorilla glass 2.0 for the screen...this might be the first legit droid where no case is required.call quality from mobiletechreview, phonedog, cnet, and others all say this phone is excellent, as is the smoothness of the web browser and the gps.the only negative is that the battery isn't removable so the battery in the phone is all you get...what that means for me is nothing though since i have a car charger and charger at the office, not to mention the docking station doubles as one and looks good on my desk.for anyone who's been a fan of motorola's old razr, their new droids, or just needs a new phone, this is the best one that's out there right now...yes better than the iphone, especially if you like to customize things...nothing competes with android in that regard.the camera and the videocamera so far got good reviews as well, with the camera side of it getting higher marks, especially when showing off the videos to your friends on the big screen.cloud service is standard as well as a smart actions app that can customize how the phone works everywhere you go...for instance it uses gps to detect when you're at work, connecting you to the wi-fi there, making your phone ringer change to vibrate on days when u have a meeting, etc..it's a really cool idea.finally through motorola you can sync your pc to the phone and transfer data instantly...take a note in word for class, the note appears in word back on your dorm laptop, want to listen to your itunes, music can be streamed from your pc's playlist without you having to actually put the songs on your phone.it's a great device and everyone who's negative about it just for the price is really stupid...either get it now for $249 like the sad sad people paid 2 months ago for the bionic, like people did for the thunderbolt, and like people did for the revolution....or wait till black friday and/or christmas when i'm sure some sort of sale will be happening...either way it's a good phone." **** 'stupid'
---'they also changed their penny sale promotion in the last days from all phones to all phones in stock after repeated assurances that the price would be good throughout the sale.' **** 'good'
---';  even if the phone would not have been at a low price of $111.111 i would have purchased it without regrets.my actual rating for the phone itself would be 4.25-4.5.the fact that i feel like i got the best deal of the 2011 holiday season pushes the rating to 5 stars.' **** 'low'
---'however, if you are worried about battery life on the go, there are some wonderful external batteries available on amazon, about the the size of a cellphone themselves, that should solve that problem before you get your phone into a charger.overall, a great phone -- and one i definitely want when i am eligible for the discounted price in january.' **** 'eligible'

Positive Reviews:

---'phone is indeed "thin and light" and feels good in hand, the back bump where the camera is adds a nice "disruption" to the otherwise would be dull flat surface, and with that when i am comfortably leaving it lying on the desk, the bump acts as a "mini stand" or whatever you would call it.android works perfectly, apps downloaded installed no problem so far, and the essential apps comes with the phone all make sense (except the games, tho).in my view razr is superior in all aspects to some of the other "most-admired" phones, only complaints at this time are: 1) no unlimited data plan; 2) not much accessories to select from yet; and 3) no "razr-s" model that uses a smaller screen (say 3.7 inch).' **** 'unlimited'

Positive Reviews:

---'battery life is good, given the dual core processor power of the phone.now the bad:my 9 year old lg vx4400 has much better audio quality.' **** 'good'
---'i can go through 100 mb of data a day on 4g and still have ~20% battery left at the end of the day so i guess battery life is good based on that.' **** 'good'
---"i know this phone is fast but...  this phone has the poorest battery life of all the phones i have had - i can't get more than about 6 or 7 hours before i have to recharge." **** 'poorest'
---"onto their customers.so - after my rambling here - i would say that all-in-all the razr is a nice piece of equipment - but don't be disillusioned by statements about longer battery life... it's a hog just like every other smartphone." **** 'longer'
---'pros - google android os with ice cream sandwich upgrade capability, 4g speeds, 4.3" screen, hdmi port, 1080p video and 8mp camera, access to mainly free appscons - very short battery life, lacking power management and very limited alarm features, somewhat fickle hotspot capabilities, usb tethering will not work without third party or rooting, email capabilities lack rival platforms (may be considered more taste by some).having recently purchased the droid razr phone as a result of my blackberry giving up the ghost, i was reminded of several lessons learned.' **** 'short'

Negative Reviews:

---"two things you must be aware of - battery life rapidly declines and the battery is non-changeable so get used to carrying the charger for midday recharging (and i'm a low/moderate user) and i'm only 2 months in- this isnt a world friendly phone outside the us (i should have double checked the specs as i know wireless well) this phone is billed as 3g/4g but it really means cdma/lte." **** 'aware'
---'the battery could be better but it is amazing compared to the thunderbolt.. most people that have horrible battery life need to see the apps refresh rates most of my friends never do and have facebook checking every hour and twitter too.' **** 'better'

Negative Reviews:

---"two things you must be aware of - battery life rapidly declines and the battery is non-changeable so get used to carrying the charger for midday recharging (and i'm a low/moderate user) and i'm only 2 months in- this isnt a world friendly phone outside the us (i should have double checked the specs as i know wireless well) this phone is billed as 3g/4g but it really means cdma/lte." **** 'aware'

---'first, the battery has been criticized, not only for its lifespan, but its inaccessibility.' **** 'first'
---'for example, disabling 4g and going with the significantly slower 3g (verizon has probably the slowest 3g of the carriers) yields at least 5 hours of extra battery in a given day, even with regular usage.' **** 'extra'
---"not playing games all day, but you're working your job or learning in class which in theory means you're using it maybe 2 or so hours a day) can help in reaching the lauded battery life levels.again though, since it's an inaccessible battery, you'll need to be near a charger or carry an external battery pack, such asmotorola universal dual-charging portable power pack (black, retail packaging)or something larger if you need more power than this puts out." **** 'inaccessible'
---'the irreplaceable battery is a downer, yes.' **** 'irreplaceable'

---"it slows the device down a little bit but provides their own custom interface that creates a more flashy transition between apps, screens, etc.also motorola's razr has kevlar on the back for strength, a nano-coating on the outside and inside for splash protection, and gorilla glass 2.0 for the screen...this might be the first legit droid where no case is required.call quality from mobiletechreview, phonedog, cnet, and others all say this phone is excellent, as is the smoothness of the web browser and the gps.the only negative is that the battery isn't removable so the battery in the phone is all you get...what that means for me is nothing though since i have a car charger and charger at the office, not to mention the docking station doubles as one and looks good on my desk.for anyone who's been a fan of motorola's old razr, their new droids, or just needs a new phone, this is the best one that's out there right now...yes better than the iphone, especially if you like to customize things...nothing competes with android in that regard.the camera and the videocamera so far got good reviews as well, with the camera side of it getting higher marks, especially when showing off the videos to your friends on the big screen.cloud service is standard as well as a smart actions app that can customize how the phone works everywhere you go...for instance it uses gps to detect when you're at work, connecting you to the wi-fi there, making your phone ringer change to vibrate on days when u have a meeting, etc..it's a really cool idea.finally through motorola you can sync your pc to the phone and transfer data instantly...take a note in word for class, the note appears in word back on your dorm laptop, want to listen to your itunes, music can be streamed from your pc's playlist without you having to actually put the songs on your phone.it's a great device and everyone who's negative about it just for the price is really stupid...either get it now for $249 like the sad sad people paid 2 months ago for the bionic, like people did for the thunderbolt, and like people did for the revolution....or wait till black friday and/or christmas when i'm sure some sort of sale will be happening...either way it's a good phone." **** 'removable'
---"my htc incredible gets the colors very nicely.verdict: if you are new to android or not a power user (i define power user as someone who needs an extra battery but doesn't root their handsets) and love the this appeal....this phone is for you." **** 'extra'
---"-_- you have to plug it in at least twice a day to make sure it stays in the middle.. because the battery doesn't last that long with basic use.. this is all my personal opinion.. the weight just makes me feel like i will break it in one shot even though i've dropped way more then twice and it seems to have not been affected by it.. except losing signal and having to restart it.. but thats also a normal way for cellphones.. i just want to let ya'll know if your looking for a phone that has a good feel in the hand, that can be used for multiple things or just the simple things as talking this is not it... it overheats for everything.." **** 'last'

Negative Reviews:

---"it is not necessary to carry a portable charger, for the average user, (i am a super power user) a day's worth of batter is something this phone can provide and more.-screenthe screen maybe pentile, but the only time it makes a difference is when your typing, the boxes around the letters just don't look right." **** 'necessary'

---'after that the phone just plain knocked out, not responsive to the charger or power button with a black screen.i am staying away from this phone and contemplating changing service providers away from verizon as well....' **** 'responsive'
---'the location of the port makes no difference if you are plugging it into the wall using a regular charger.' **** 'regular'

Positive Reviews:

---"okay, i might get in trouble from a certain fast food chain for the title of my review, but it's true, i am lovin' the droid razr." **** 'true'
---'half the one-star reviews could really be three or four star reviews but are one solely based on customer service...stop that; first and foremost, review the *product* because customer service likely came after you got the product.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'checked it at the verizon store and saw that the internal memory is only 8 gb and not 16gb as stated in the technical review.' **** 'technical'
---"!updating my review ---since my original review i haven't had any problems with my location-triggered smart actions." **** 'original'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'although i did have it crash because i went app crazy and one of the apps did harm the phone, no worries, reinstalled and am more careful about what i download.if you have been getting the stupid spam notifications, for me it was the mp3 downloader app.' **** 'crazy'
---'oh wait theres also multiple music apps that come preinstalled lets check them all to see which one is better.' **** 'music'
---"skype users may appreciate that feature but i don't use it.there are plenty of free apps for the android os so, no problem getting what i want." **** 'free'
---'turning the lte network off worked wonders.~ operating system is very fast, installing, opening the largest apps takes only a couple seconds at most.~ actual screen size is exactly the same as my old droid x.~ switching between wireless networks and cell network has been improved, no hang ups i experienced with my x.~ although it is slimmer, height and width are greater.~ battery performance is ok once you adjust on board apps, learn to use smart actions and task manager.' **** 'largest'
---'it\'s super bright...all in all i\'m happy i bought it and have no regrets.coolest apps so far: colornote for a "to do list", akimbo player for listening to talking books, dolphin browser with the lastpass password manager for tracking all my logins.' **** 'super'
---'it\'s super bright...all in all i\'m happy i bought it and have no regrets.coolest apps so far: colornote for a "to do list", akimbo player for listening to talking books, dolphin browser with the lastpass password manager for tracking all my logins.' **** 'bright'
---'*  good reception compared to another in a fringe area.bad:*  the list of apps that it shipped w/ are awful.' **** 'awful'
---'its 4g lte which i dont really notice on downloading speeds because apps in general arent that large to begin with i am sure if i downloaded larger apps it would make a difference.' **** 'sure'
---"if i had larger hands it probably wouldn't make a difference so take that with a grain of salt.one thing that i was so excited to get an unlimited data plan is listening to pandora or watching youtube videos which tends to eat data.i hear alot of complaining about the battery life on this phone and welcome to smart phones they all have terrible battery life so at least this one is very user friendly.i think however that it is lacking in preprogramed widgets coming from an htc where there were 10 different main clocks, a calender, calculator, and the task killer isn't that great i ended up not using the factory task killer because it could end all the apps in one push you have to click off all the apps you dont want to run." **** 'want'
---'speed test shows 4 to 4.5 mps, new apps download and install in 2 blinks, my weather animated radar loads faster than it can play.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---'phone is indeed "thin and light" and feels good in hand, the back bump where the camera is adds a nice "disruption" to the otherwise would be dull flat surface, and with that when i am comfortably leaving it lying on the desk, the bump acts as a "mini stand" or whatever you would call it.android works perfectly, apps downloaded installed no problem so far, and the essential apps comes with the phone all make sense (except the games, tho).in my view razr is superior in all aspects to some of the other "most-admired" phones, only complaints at this time are: 1) no unlimited data plan; 2) not much accessories to select from yet; and 3) no "razr-s" model that uses a smaller screen (say 3.7 inch).' **** 'essential'
---'for some reason, the built-in browser appears to override the screen brightness setting so that a bright screen with other apps turns into something more grey than white with the browser.' **** 'other'
---'i also discovered several new apps which were not there before the upgrade.' **** 'new'
---'holding the home screen button now brings up all of your recent apps you can dismiss by swiping them either to the left or right (not sure that entirely closes the apps, though, but it looks cool).' **** 'recent'
---"skype users may appreciate that feature but i don't use it.there are plenty of free apps for the android os so, no problem getting what i want." **** 'plenty'
---'it\'s super bright...all in all i\'m happy i bought it and have no regrets.coolest apps so far: colornote for a "to do list", akimbo player for listening to talking books, dolphin browser with the lastpass password manager for tracking all my logins.' **** 'happy'
---'third party support (apps) is available however verizon does not condone or support this convention even when you are paying the extra $30 for hotspot and tethering capabilities and without the user having one of its unlimited data plans (grandfathered) is subjected to a 2 gig monthly limit with steep prices charged for overages.' **** 'available'
---"periodically i would drop data service completely, and wasn't able to use any apps or browsing." **** 'able'
---'this includes talking, texting, downloading new apps, playing a few games, reading the news, browsing the web and showing off the phone to the guys at work.last but not least, let me touch on 4g lte speeds.' **** 'new'
---'its 4g lte which i dont really notice on downloading speeds because apps in general arent that large to begin with i am sure if i downloaded larger apps it would make a difference.' **** 'larger'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'they also changed their penny sale promotion in the last days from all phones to all phones in stock after repeated assurances that the price would be good throughout the sale.' **** 'last'
---'i wanted to get mine replaced for the lines on the screen when i first got it, but after the first 14 days any phone you get will be a pre-broken or damaged phone that has been repaired.' **** 'first'
---'this phone is a total disappointment!while this phone worked great for the first 11 days its already time for a new one.the inner screen mysteriously cracked during a day of very light duty work in the office, rendering the phone useless.' **** 'first'
---'i have skipped this option, i have never collected on it previously.standard return policy is 15 days, but for the christmas buying season, they have graciously exteded it to january 15.  i have had my doubts early with bad signal at work, but this data abandonment for the past few days has pushed me to the point of returning it.' **** 'past'

---"i can understand people downgrading this phone because of it's battery life, but there aren't many touchscreen smart phones out there that last for days." **** 'last'
---'also, this reminds me too much of the headaches caused by proxy servers in the early days of windows servers.)' **** 'early'
