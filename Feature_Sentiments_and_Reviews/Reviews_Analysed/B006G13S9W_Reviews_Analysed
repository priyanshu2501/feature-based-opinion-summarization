---'i ended up deleting almost all of the apps to try to free up internal memory space, but i have perpetually had the "phone storage space is getting low" notification since the second week that i bought the phone, no matter how much i have deleted.2) i thought that i could also free up storage space by deleting some of the bloatware that came with the phone that i never use, but it doesn\'t let me delete any of those programs.3) periodically, the phone stops receiving text messages because it tells me that my text message memory is full.' **** 'free'
