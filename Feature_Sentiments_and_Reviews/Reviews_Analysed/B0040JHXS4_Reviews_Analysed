Positive Reviews:

---"always wanted a smartphone, but was torn between the fascinate and the droid x. went to the verizon store to play with both, didn't really care for the look of the droid x, motoblur doesn't do justice to it's graphic capabilities.spec wise the droid x is better, but once i started using the fascinate i was sold!very fast user interface, colors just pop, a sight to behold.wasn't too thrilled with bing being the default search, but when the fascinate gets froyo 2.2, google search will be an option, not a big deal anyway, don't see what all the fuss is about.the fascinate is very customizable, i totally rearranged the widgets and icons, now it looks the way i want it to!battery life is not the greatest, i get a day if i'm lucky, using the task killer app." **** 'google'
---'they say froyo will make it easy to get rid of the apps i do not use or like, and in the meantime it is easy to use google search and apps instead.the only major fault i can find with the fascinate hardware is that the power and volume physical buttons are directly across from each other on the opposite sides of the phone so that when you press one it is hard not to also press the other.' **** 'google'
---"bing search isn't bad, but google is googel... 'nuff said." **** 'bad'
---'the biggest change is that during post-installation setup you get to choose not to use bing and after that the search works as you would hope, with google, even from the search button.' **** 'google'
---"verizon has also announced that they will make the google search engine available on the official 2.2 release, however they won't be making it the search engine for other services, so when another application starts a search it will still be redirected through the verizon search portal to bing." **** 'google'
---'another method is to rip-off the google search elements from another galaxy s model and install that and a third party application launcher which will then use it, but this is probably more low level messing around than most users will want to do.' **** 'rip-off'
---'now give me a gps fix, android 2.2 froyo, and google search and i will tie the knot with my fascinate.' **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---'managed to put google search on it, thanks to enough people wanting the same thing and great forums on the internet with clear explanations on how to make these changes.' **** 'google'
---'then, by installing the .apk here:[...]you can restore all google search, map and navigation functions.' **** 'google'
---'also now has google search installed as an app.' **** 'google'
---"yes, the bing search was a poor/annoying move by verizon, but it's easily remedied with rooting or by launcher pro with the google search widget (or just wait for froyo update some time in the next month or two, google search will be added back)." **** 'google'

---'aka navigator instead of google maps.' **** 'google'

Negative Reviews:

---'they only use a handful of apps and will likely never push the fascinate to its limits.personally, next time i upgrade my phone or recommending another phone, i will have to think hard about any phone with the verizon name on it, and about verizon itself.' **** 'fascinate'

Positive Reviews:

---"!root, pull off bing, the garbage apps, and all the bloat-ware.sadly you need to root it to do this, but lets be honest here; why would you buy an android phone and not plan on rooting it?amazing gpu in this thing, runs quake 3 at over 90 fps.make sure you install the free wifi tether for root users and dolphin web browser so you can use all the features vzw wants you to pay for... but for free!use the built in wifi and you can get away with the cheap data plan!the cost of the device paired with vzw being the only company that has unlimited data plans still (at this time) makes this an easy winner if you know enough to be dangerous.still waiting on the froyo 2.2 update though, this means you cant copy apps to the sd card or view sites that are using flash 10.0 or greater in case you're curious.do not buy this if you are not going to root, get a tonka, playschool or apple you know, something more simple." **** 'free'

---'the screen is fantastic, and overall construction quality is good.' **** 'good'
---'pictures and videos look crystal clear and even though the x has an 8mp camera compared to a 5mp on the fascinate, the quality appears better on the fascinate than it ever did on my droid x.  as for screen quality, either option will be a great choice, but the super amoled screen really makes the color pop and makes everything just look much bolder and colorful.' **** 'better'
