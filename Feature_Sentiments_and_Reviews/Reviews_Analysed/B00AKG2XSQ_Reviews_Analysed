__________('apps', 'to', 'sd')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"first of all, yes it's a good phone; and it probably has the longest battery life of most smart phones.however, the 300-480 hours of standby time promoted on websites, actually is only 48 hours when doing absolutely nothing with it, and leaving the phone in an area with very good reception.when being in a bad reception area, or use the phone for very light work, the battery goes down to 24 hours.when playing very light games, like cardgames, or browsing the internet, it goes down to 8-13 hours of use.3d games last between 4-6 hours; and most chargers won't be able to keep up with charging the battery and providing enough power to the phone to not lose battery at the same time.second major reason not to buy this phone, is because it comes with 1,6gb of internal memory.android used to fit on 800mb of memory, but 4.1 uses over 1,2gb of this 1,6gb of memory; leaving you with a good ~200 mb of memory left for a good 10 to 15 apps; or about 2 or 3 games.every system update, or apps update will result in 'out of memory' messages, and forcing you to uninstall smaller apps.many pre-installed apps can't be uninstalled, even if you wanted it, and can't even be disabled (some of the t-mobile apps), and keep on downloading updates that you will never need.this phone came with android 4.1, and was outdated the day 4.1.2 came out, due to lack of memory!apps to move data to the sd card won't work in 4.1+generally the external sd card is only for audio, video, or personal photos.don't buy!if you go android, make sure you got more than 2gb of internal memory available, 2.5 or 3gb minimum recommended!!" **** 'smaller'

Negative Reviews:

---"i am considering returning it to t-mobile and eating the re-stocking charge (maybe it's waived in 14 days, i have to read the sales contract); the poor reception is very aggravating.it is, however, the least expensive 4g data, android 4.0 phone; the samsung's are now price like iphone's and they don't seem to have more functionality than other 4g data & 4.0 phones.the menu steps are significantly different from my previous android 2.0 phone." **** 'expensive'

---"the jellybean update was to allow the l9 to move apps to the card, among other improvements.the battery life seems less than middle-of-the-road to me, which really kind of sucks, for a product like this, released in late 2012.don't get me wrong, these disappointments don't mean spending $ 400.00 to $ 1000.00 on such a device makes any more sense, it doesn't." **** 'less'

---"i really love how fast it is all around and how nice it fits and feels in my hand, which is one thing i found difficult with other phones because of my fairly large hands there just weren't alot of phones out there i could buy without it costing me an arm and a leg.so the rating i gave it basically came down to 4 stars because it lacked one major essential which i will get to in a min.- the size and quality of the screen is great.- it's light weight and is well put together.- i love the big screen and how well all my apps look on it, the speed of the phone is definitely were it shines especially in it's price range.- fairly long battery life, lasted me a whole day on one charge with using my phone for games, music and searching the web.- though the camera is only 5 megapixels, it's full hd 1080p video capture is terrific not to mention the pictures." **** 'music'
