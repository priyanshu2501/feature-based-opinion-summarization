---'shoot, most watches that only tell time are far more expensive!' **** 'expensive'
---"do not buyi bought it because i just wanted a regular watch that has a few cool features to play around and it was good compared to the price.you can find everywhere online that this product has many design flaws and they are all true, the device constantly disconnects, and you have to approve on the phone for it to reconnect, so you actually have to take the phone out of your poket to pair all over again.i would leave 0 stars but is not possble, now it turn on fully charged and goes off right after it pairs, it is fully charged and same thing, reset the thing and updated the fw and same issue.i have a samsung galaxy s3 and worked fine (not perfect due to what was mentioned before) for over a week, so i called the horrible sony support and they told me it wouldn't work with my device and when i told them that i had worked for over a week with no issues they changed the story.they wanted me to try with a sony phone so i got one and recorded a video of what it does, they never accepted to receive it and had me send pop, then said they said they will send a replacement.a month later i call and they said they didn't send me nothing and they will not send me anything until i send the garbage back, i told them that due to the location of the device it will cost me more to send it than to throw it away or get another one, asked for a sup and took a long time, they offer a callback to finally tell me that if i didn't send it back they won't send me nothing and refused to receive the 1 min video that will show the device will go off on its own.i will try to contact amazon to see if they can help me as they always had.i used xperia phones and accessories before, and switched to samsung because of the same type of things, i guess i made the right decision." **** 'long'
