---'i used the online users guide once or twice to figure out how to set something up but most of it has been really easy to figure out and learn.' **** 'easy'
---"but it definitely works for me.i now have a phone that runs lots of useful apps (most of which cost nothing), integrates well with google services, and is something i'd be unhappy to leave at home.i use gmail for my primary email account (and forward other email to my gmail account), and checking, navigating, searching, categorizing, etc." **** 'unhappy'

---'if you made me say something negative about it, the only thing i could think of would be i wish there were more separation between the keys on the slideout keyboard.' **** 'negative'

---'i still think the app store is lacking, especially when it comes to games and leisure apps, but it makes up for it with solid apps that make much more use of the hardware than iphone apps do (eg setting power profiles depending on different states of the phone).the high res screen is nice for browsing, and it renders a lot of web pages at full resolution.' **** 'solid'
---'google\'s "marketplace" is almost a misnomer, since so many apps are available for free.' **** 'available'
---";) )hey, it's verizon's network, which is just plain awesome.the iphone isn't due out on verizon until summer, from what i understand, and who knows when verizon will get google's phone.i love gmail and i love the integration (which is to be expected) between android and google's apps (like google docs, etc)." **** 'google'
---"the android market is like the apps store with apple except most of the apps are free or cheap, it is not bloated with a million useless apps, and the best part if its a paid app you try it for 24 hours and if you don't like it you uninstall it and are not charged for it, that alone is awesome!" **** 'free'

---'there are no built-in photo editing tools to speak of (although there are a couple nice photo apps available in the android market).' **** 'available'
---"* the apps -- the reason there are not as many huge, shiny apps like some of the more elaborate iphone games is that app executables can't be stored on the memory card, just in the phone's memory, so this severely limits the amount of space for larger, more elaborate apps[correction]." **** 'elaborate'
---'favorite apps: facebook, weather channel, google maps/navigation, web browser.' **** 'favorite'
---'the choices are endless and to say that a market is better than another market because of the number of apps each has is just plain stupid.' **** 'stupid'

---"it really is too bad they don't store the apps on the sd card, as that would address this problem.when i want to voice-dial, i just hold down the camera button and it works (albeit a little slowly) the same as on my moto razr--but with deadly accuracy." **** 'bad'
---"don't carry around a dozen cards, just pop open key ring rewards and it displays the scannable upc-listen, made by google, downloads/finds/plays podcasts-my tracks, also made by google, works with google maps & gps, tracks information about runs/walks/drives with speed, distance, etc-mototorch led, uses the camera's led flash as a flashlight-quote pro, the best stock app on android-pandora, free streaming music-pure grid calendar, a nice home screen widgit for your calendar-shazam, listens to music playing and tells you what song it is-sportstap, the best sports scores/stats app on android-taskiller, kills all running apps to free up memory-weather widgits, gives you an htc sense-style weather flip clock widgit" **** 'free'

Negative Reviews:

---'available apps in the "market" don\'t even come close to those available for the iphone.so yes, the droid screen is big and looks good, internet access is quick, and sound quality is excellent, but if you care about functionality (including some predictability of battery life), and you can\'t wait for apple to develop an iphone for verizon, then go with a blackberry or buy a basic phone and carry around an ipod touch.' **** 'available'
---'like apple the apps available will grow with time-so far no complaints here.' **** 'available'
---'the droid was easiest to use, had a better on-screen keyboard (plus the physical keyboard), and was far more customizable than the other phones we looked at (including the iphone).the droid is a fast, easy to use, beast with absoutely fantastic apps.' **** 'beast'

---'use doubletwist to convert and sync your video media to your droid.fast: uses the same processor as the iphone and there are task killer apps that can make it run faster by shutting down certain apps running in the background.' **** 'certain'
---'has flash (and can be used as a flashlight with certain apps) and records video at 720 x 480.removable battery: gives you the option to prolong your phone as we all know, all batteries lose charge eventually.file managers: you can hook this phone up to your computer and see all the files and folders...unlike manipulative apple.' **** 'certain'

---'it might not have quite as many apps available as an iphone (yet!)' **** 'available'

---"it is not perfect - the keyboard and camera could both be a little better, battery life is good but not great, but you won't find a better smartphone on verizon - and depending on what you look for in a phone, you may not find a better phone on any network.pros:-big, sharp screen-blazingly fast processor-android 2.0-good browsing experience-free turn-by-turn voice navigation-huge number of apps on the android market-decent battery life-very solidly built-physical keyboard-very thin for a phone with slide out keyboardcons:-keyboard could be improved-camera shots are somewhat washed out-no multitouch in native apps (although apps downloaded from the market do have multitouch - its a software thing, not a droid thing)-a bit heavysome of my favorite apps:-better keyboard, a replacement for the on screen keyboard." **** 'native'
