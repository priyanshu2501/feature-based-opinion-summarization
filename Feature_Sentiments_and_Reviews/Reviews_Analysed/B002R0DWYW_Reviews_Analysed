---'i bought nokia 5800 navigation edition 1 month back and this is the best phone i can have in that price range.it is build on nokia 5800 express music well know as tube, with gps also in place.what else you need a phone:complete media player,gps system,internet browsing,touch screen,camera and video recording.and above all this is a phone.touch screen seems to be nice for me and to make it more effective you can use stylus.gps works in outdoor without any network connection required for the same.music is excellent.you can download maps and upgrade your mobile applications with the nokia suite provided.complete car kit when you use the phone as gpsthe only thing which was not upto the mark is the camera quality, i thought 3.2 mega pixel will do wonders, but any how i wont be using this as camerai downloaded full movies in this phone and it is really working great.preloaded with 8gb memory which is good enough to store maps, music and movies and you can extend it anytime.if somebody is looking for a smartphone at smart price nokia 5800 navigation edition is the answer to it.' **** 'music'

---"sometimes a few minutes if you're not in an opened place.why can't i think of anything else?symbian os version 5:this is my first time using this os and it has been good to me.everything is very responsive and installing apps is a breeze.you can open a free ovi store account on your phone to download free apps, games and other stuff.if you want to use an all in one instant messenger to compliment your wifi, i suggest downloading an app called nimbuzz in the ovi store and ditch the default im app on your phone.surfing the web is decent, but the screen may be a bit small for prolonged surfing.ovi store has lots of free apps(some you have to pay)youtube videos play well, but don't expect to watch them in hd like you would on your pc.[..." **** 'free'
