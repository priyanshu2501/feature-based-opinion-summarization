---'and the battery for some random reason my battery stops at two different spots it can ether be at 70% or at 90% witch really sucks for long days with no charger because by 4:00 pm after being unpluged at 8:00am it is already down to 30%' **** 'charger'

Negative Reviews:

---"we got these phones in the mail and my initial thought was that they looked and functioned great and came with an awesome bundle of accessories.within the first few days we noticed my wife's phone would die within a few minutes and we tried a new battery with no luck.data would be unavailable randomlysound only works if you squeeze the phone just rightautomatic restarts randomlybattery is unable to chargewe tried to warranty the phones but it turns out they were made for hong kong and these people just buy overseas phones and resell them here." **** 'first'
---'a real star looser for me.update: 02/28/2011:i have now used the atrix for a few days so it was prudent to give an update.battery life:the battery life is not to great.' **** 'prudent'
