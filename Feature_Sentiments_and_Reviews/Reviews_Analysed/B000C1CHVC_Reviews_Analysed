---'also, the supplied headphones are kind of booty.' **** 'kind'
---'So I was able to pull the headphones out and stick a cassete adapter and use the MP3 player in my car.' **** 'able'
---"Here is a list of pros and cons:PROS- Combines MP3 player and cell phone- Nice stereo quality and more memory then most other models- Good battary life- Cool design and multiple face covers- Easy to navigate powerful softwareCONS- Larger and heavier then most other modern phones- Voice recognition is exremely poor to the point of not being usable; defeats the purpose of bluetooth and not having to use the dial pad- Swivel design makes it hard to open and close with one hand and to dial numbers- Large external display is fragile and can break- Not enough memory to be a real MP3 player and it's not extendable- FM radio could not tune into any stations (maybe unless you are standing right under the antenna)- Included headphones are uncomfortable and do not stay in the ears- You can not use your own headphones because the phone doesn't have a stanard 3-mm headphone jack- Camera produces poor grainy imagesI hope to try the next model of this phone or another phone that will combine the features I'm looking for with small size and extensibility." **** 'uncomfortable'
---'The included headphones are actually very good, and this is great because included with them is a handsfree, so you can be listening to music, get a call, answer by touching the single button on the handsfree, then hang up with the same button, and music will pick up where it left off when the call was received, and this is awesome.' **** 'good'
---'Volume with headphones is low; if you want to jack it up, manually adjust the equalizer to max settings and you will get a significant volume boost.' **** 'low'
---'But the quality of headphones is very good.' **** 'good'
---"Headphones are hooked up via SE's proprietary connector, but it allows you to hookup your favorite headphones to it so I caution you about the extended wire length." **** 'favorite'
