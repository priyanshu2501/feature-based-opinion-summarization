Negative Reviews:

---'there is this new wireless tech that i am not familiar with, maybe os x will support that soon and make the usb irrelevant.as soon as my 2 year contract is up i will get a similar phone with a hard-drive and new battery tech, fuel cells, ultra-capacitors or best nuclear batteries that last 20 years, and basically the same features, that will be the ultimate phone.the cords are a bit strange in that they will almost plug in left or right but only one direction is correct, they work ok but you have to look at them to plug-in.all the buttons work great, i like the swivel, the battery latest forever, it charges from usb, the ear buds fit good.the blue/black covers are kind of ugly, i guess thats about it.i have just had it for 2 days, i will update if i find any complaints.ooooh, the reception of the radio sucks so far.the reception of the phone looks low by the bars but i think its really no worse then other phones it just has potentially much better receptions so that is why it appears lower at times.' **** 'new'

Positive Reviews:

---"this phone turns off when you don't want it to (like about 3-4 times per day), the buttons don't work well, the service is very slow, and poor (with this phone as opposed to cingular with my old phone), and the storage capacity for songs is very low--approximately one album at a time." **** 'low'

---"here is a list of pros and cons:pros- combines mp3 player and cell phone- nice stereo quality and more memory then most other models- good battary life- cool design and multiple face covers- easy to navigate powerful softwarecons- larger and heavier then most other modern phones- voice recognition is exremely poor to the point of not being usable; defeats the purpose of bluetooth and not having to use the dial pad- swivel design makes it hard to open and close with one hand and to dial numbers- large external display is fragile and can break- not enough memory to be a real mp3 player and it's not extendable- fm radio could not tune into any stations (maybe unless you are standing right under the antenna)- included headphones are uncomfortable and do not stay in the ears- you can not use your own headphones because the phone doesn't have a stanard 3-mm headphone jack- camera produces poor grainy imagesi hope to try the next model of this phone or another phone that will combine the features i'm looking for with small size and extensibility." **** 'uncomfortable'
---'volume with headphones is low; if you want to jack it up, manually adjust the equalizer to max settings and you will get a significant volume boost.overall, a fantastic phone, highly recommended, 4  stars.' **** 'low'

Negative Reviews:

---'the sound quality is ok but with better headphones quality is much improved.the included software is not very good.' **** 'better'
---"the headphones double as a handsfree headset in addition to the fm antennae, so it's well worth carrying and using over a bluetooth headset, imo.i was able to get both my pda and my laptop to pair up with it and use it as a modem for internet connection, although my laptop was a bit flaky and did require a bluetooth upgrade and reboot to get it working." **** 'double'
---'the included headphones are actually very good, and this is great because included with them is a handsfree, so you can be listening to music, get a call, answer by touching the single button on the handsfree, then hang up with the same button, and music will pick up where it left off when the call was received, and this is awesome.battery life is supposedly fantastic, though it has not been so great for me; i think this is due to receiving poor reception in my home, so the phone constantly searches for a signal, draining the battery faster.' **** 'good'

__________('call',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the best part is the sharp call quality.' **** 'sharp'
---'it turns off when you swivel it open, it turns off when you make a call, it turns off when you look at it the wrong way.it also has a curious issue where it decides that you have "no access to network" even though you have five bars and are in the same place you\'ve made calls hundreds of times.what is really disconcerting is the technical support on the sony ericsson website gives some of the most disingenous troubleshooting i have ever encountered.for the random shut off problem, a known issue that you can easily find complaints about here on amazon and all across the web, sony ericsson offers this plum answer: "if your phone turns itself off when being transported, it is likely that an object on your pocket or bag has activated the on/off button.' **** 'open'

Negative Reviews:

---'the call handling while listening to music works well, pausing the player and letting you answer the call via the included headset mic.there were a few bugs when i first got it.' **** 'answer'
