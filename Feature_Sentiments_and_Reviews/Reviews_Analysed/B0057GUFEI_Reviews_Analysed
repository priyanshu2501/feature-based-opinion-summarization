__________('much', 'better')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the camera is much better quality than my previous phone and it has many other great features.' **** 'much'
---'i got the lg 505c and while it works at work i like the os and menu system and especially the reject capabilities on the 800g much better.' **** 'much'
---"in my opinion the lg 800g is a much better value.these lg 800g's under this offer are all software version 10d (s/w v10d) which is why they are discounted with triple minutes." **** 'much'
---"this is a much better plan for a 'light' user than a contract phone." **** 'much'
---'i had this same phone through net10 but when i saw this deal, i returned it to get this much better tracfone package.' **** 'much'
---"sound quality is much better than any previous net10 phone i've had." **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---"it worked on sprint's network which is fine in larger cities and near highways, but is not as good as tracfone's reception bars in less populated areas.this is a much better phone than the few sti offers, with many of the features like camera, video, mp3 player, my sti phone lacked." **** 'much'

__________('old', 'tracfone')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the ten minutes i had on my old tracfone became 30 on my new one.' **** 'new'
---'i was also concerned about being able to successfully transfer my minutes and phone number from my old tracfone to my new lg800g.boy, was my skepticism a waste of energy!' **** 'new'
---'later called customer service to transfer my minutes and service from my old tracfone phone to my new tracfone.' **** 'new'
---"end result is 1400 minutes instead of the 1200 you would normally get.the biggest hassle i've had so far is getting the minutes and service from my old tracfone transfered onto the new one." **** 'new'
---'the phone was easy to use, much clearer reception than my older tracfone, so i ordered a second for myself with the same unbelievable offer.' **** 'second'

Negative Reviews:

---'i called tracfone (was on hold for full 1/2 hour and then spoke to someone i could barely understand) and was told this has nothing to do with tracfone and i need to contact the seller and complain.' **** 'hold'
---'i am not sure why other reviewers claimed that triple minutes for life was not a tracfone promo, especially since it clearly states "triple minutes for life" on the phone packaging.a few thoughs on the whole activation/triple minutes debate that weems to surround this product:i believe the whole process may have worked well for me because i did not activate the phone until after i had the old number and minutes transferred from my old tracfone to my new one.' **** 'new'
---'!i was due to add minutes to my other tracfone, but i upgraded to this phone and got triple minutes instead of the double that came with my old phone.best part is this was cheaper than the one year minutes for my old phone would have been.i called the 800# that came with it and gave the person the minutes code that came with the phone.' **** 'other'
---'my old, simple tracfone was much better.' **** 'simple'
---'however, tracfone received is 2010 model and battery requires daily recharging which may be an indication of old battery and suspect item is possibly a refurbished one; also have been unable to set up voicemail as per instructions and so far unable to contact tracfone.' **** 'unable'

__________('days',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"numbers/letters are sometimes put in wrong due to the location it thinks i touch - and yes, i've re-calibrated it several times and still the same result.a few good things1) triple minutes - yes, that is the best thing about this phone and the main reason i got it - plus the thickness is nice too.2) battery life is pretty decent3) volume - well, i think it might have been what i had it set to, but now seems better.4) alarm clock - nice feature to set certain days to wake you up - although with the pocket dial my clock got disabled and changed the other morning and i didn't catch it - luckly i woke up about 15 minutes late.would i buy this phone again - nope, the first reasons above...now i'm scared to pull the trigger on another phone that has a touch screen for fear of how it behaves with the touch." **** 'certain'

---"it did work eventually but took several days, mostly due to the fact that i wasn't on my computer for an extended period, so i couldn't sinc with one of the service reps.  once i did i was activated in minutes and new minutes added tripled as promised." **** 'due'
