Positive Reviews:

---"anyway, here are what i like and don't like about this phone.what i like- great value: you can't beat paying $50 for a 4g phone with no contract.- good performance - thanks to it's dual core processor (1.2 ghz).- android 4.0 - many of the metro's phone are still running the older ginger-bread os (at a higher price)- accepts microsd cards - i use the 32 gb card but i hear it also accepts 64 gb microsd card as well.- good battery life - it lasted 2x more when compared to my work phone (samsung galaxy s3).- front facing camera - great for skype- very compact & light (fairly thin as well).what i don't like- low resolution screen - it's only 480-by-320-pixel resolution- no hdmi connection- lots of metro's bloatware apps but that's with all metro phones.- speakerphone is weak so don't count on using it much for conference calls.- as with all metro phones, you won't be able to upgrade the os (unless you root it).all in all, its the best metro phone for the money." **** 'higher'
---'the lg motion was a great 2012 phone that has been replaced by newer 2014 models that are designed for the new metropcs/t-mobile 4g lte network.neighborhood metropcs stores are having a sale on 2014 4g lte models until march 1st, including the lg f6 for $79 and the lg f3 for $49.the motion was a great choice in 2012. however, in 2014 metropcs stores have newer phones that are much faster and at a better price.' **** 'better'

__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"other apps metro put on it don't seem that great like the navigation." **** 'other'

Negative Reviews:

---"not tech savvy but here's my input:pros:- cheap, looks great, does its job well (used it for calling, texting, schedule planning, and rarely the internet).- plays games and music apps well.cons:- battery life is sub-par, i live in an area with coverage near an area without coverage, and going into buildings would quickly drain my battery.- battery occasionally overheats to dangerous temperatures: i've had it in my pocket only to feel it burning my skin, grabbing it and immediately taking out the battery (which was too friggen hot to touch)." **** 'music'
---'i wanted a better phone upgrade from the samsung admire, with 5 gig of phone space i figured i can not go wrong, i was right,the phone also has a sims card ,i use metro pcs and it is a crap service ,but this phone is amazing it picks up 4g in my area and boom you are blazing fast off and running i thought at first the 4g thing was a joke but trust me this phone and the 4g lite is amazing and fast, i like the easy apps and also the uninstalling of the bulk ware ..out of the box this phone jumped, i had a little trouble with hooking it up with metro they asked me where i bought the phone ,after a few attempts i was on line and hooked up facebook works fast even away from your home service router and i can play videos on youtube without lag, for the money this phone in my opinion is definitely worth it' **** 'easy'

__________('fast',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'this phone is faster then the htc onex and galaxy s2 the phone is super fast the only down side to the phone is the speaker is not that loud and the screen is small other then that the phone is very nice for 149 out of contract you cant beat it' **** 'super'
---"the battery life last about 3 hours under heavy use (playing on-line constantly, or recording in hd), but recharging is super fast, when battery level hit 7% it took 26 min to charge to 100%...the speed of 4g depends on your location but when i have it using wifi it is blazing fast, it is also great without wifi using straight 4g..it does have a lot of built in apps i never use but they can be disabled in the 'apps' setting." **** 'super'

Negative Reviews:

---'i like it more than an iphone 4. it is super fast, super small, and very comfortable in the pocket which i like.' **** 'super'

Positive Reviews:

---'this review is entirely based on that as i have not used any other iphone higher than iphone 4.the good:*price(assuming you are not paying over $100)*gorilla glass(hard to break screen)*dual processor*cheap metro pcs plan*icons provide more personalization than current iphone*very light and thin, which makes it possible using it one-handedthe bad:*talk and sound quality are average at best*weak batterythe bottom line:to save money, i had to say good-bye to my iphone 4 from at&t; and switch to metropcs.' **** 'average'
---'if you take a picture of the landscape and never look at it anywhere but on the phone, it will probably be ok.sound quality is bad - either for playing a video or listening to music.' **** 'bad'
