Positive Reviews:

---"the reasons why i chose the milestone were because i wanted a phone with an android system, the qwerty keyboard, large screen (for gps and web browsing) and the look.i now have the phone for over a month and here are my impressions on the phone:call quality is very good,no dropped calls, connections all work well, i live in europe and have 3g network (you can disable 3g network if you want), wifi connection and internet browsing also very good, five stars here, touchscreen is also good, never had a touchscreen device and had no problems adapting, i've tested other android devices that dont have touchscreens as good as this one, however not as good as the touchscreen in the iphone, honestly dont think any device can top that.the qwerty keyboard is also excellent, many reviews say the keyboard is flat and the keys are small, but for me personally the keyboard is fine.the battery life is one of the downs of the phone, for someone that never had a smarthphone like this, will notice short battery life, especially in the first days because of the overuse, i set my screen brightness to the minimum and have app killers and battery improvement apps, and with my normal use (some calls, text msg, some music) i get around 2 full days max." **** 'short'
