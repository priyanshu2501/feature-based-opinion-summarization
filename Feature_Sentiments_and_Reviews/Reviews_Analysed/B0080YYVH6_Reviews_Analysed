__________('memory',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'it needs more on board memory, currently only 400mb available.' **** 'available'
---"what a piece of trash, the touchscreen sucks -  it has hardly any memory - it's slow and can't handle more than a few loaded apps at a time -  the casio gzone or whatever interface is lame -  call quality sucks -  buttons are in stupid positions so you can't tell if its upside down without actually looking at it - dumbest design ever not even worth protecting.on the plus side i will say i have thrown it as far as i can several times and against concrete a bunch of times and it still works (if you can call what it does &#34;working&#34;)i seriously think verizon sold this phone as some kind of an inside joke because you really can't do much of anything with it beside make phone calls with poor quality or tether the slow data connection to something else more useful (3g usually isn't bad but for some reason this phone's 3g is exceptionally slow)." **** 'slow'

__________('smart',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"at work i us it to listen to internet radio with headphones (some head phones don't connect so be sure try a few if it doesn't work at first), while i drive i use a gps the speakers are nice and loud, the screen is great (you have to push a little harder than a normal touch screen but not by much), photo quality is 'so so' but it get the job done (they come out grainy and higher res pics can't be sent out for some reason), i don't like the pre-loaded rooted apps like bing but you can't get away from that (at least not) and i love that i can rinse (i make sure the seals are closed)  it off when it gets dirty.battery life is like any other smart phone, it depends on your apps and gps usage, if i'm using it to navigate it will last for about 2 hours, if  i'm listening to internet radio 3 hours, normal texting calling 5 hours so i just keep it charged.as a person who is prone to dropping anything i'm hold this phone is amazing." **** 'other'
