---"UPDATE (4 July) - The inertia scrolling is not as terrible as I first said, but does vary with applications and takes some getting used to.-The accelerometer, which detects the direction the phone is tilted, is often incorrect and the phone is very slow to change the screen's display between portrait and landscape.-Oftentimes, the phone must be unlocked 2 or 3 times to get the LCD's backlight to turn on." **** 'vary'
---'The out of memory message suggested closing other applications, which I did, and which resolved nothing.' **** 'other'
---'If you want to continue using it after some days (about 3 weeks I gather), you need to purchase it - similar to QuickOffice.>> The number of applications available for this phone is somewhat more limited; this is only the second Nokia phone to use the new S60 5th edition user interface w/touch-screen support.' **** 'available'

---'Nokia N97 mistake is the limited applications available for it, i wish that nokia can really improve it by adding free of charge upgrades for the following:1- HTML format email reading, exchange2- Office3- Adobe4- FlashReal player should support more video codecs MKV, H. 264Regards, I just received my N97.' **** 'available'
