---'there are a bunch of free apps too which are tried.' **** 'free'
---"it does require quite a bit of fiddling to get some of the settings the way you like but overall it's very easy to use,  i love the 32 gigs of internal memory,  provides lots of space for apps and music,  the video quality on the phone is also very good but the format support is limited." **** 'music'
---'it gets stuck in the function key mode frequently, and you have to go back to the archiac touch screen interface.symbian, and the overwhelming majority of apps available are euro-centric.' **** 'available'
---'some can be closed from the open apps window, others only from within the app itself.so many things are not well thought out.' **** 'open'
---"but you can also run many free symbian apps and java apps on it and transfer of data is a breeze (it just looks like a drive to the computer).some people don't like the resistive touch screen - but i find it just as easy to use as the capacitive on the iphone." **** 'free'
---'some apps are just slow regardless of how many apps you have open, including the camera as well as active notes.' **** 'open'

Negative Reviews:

---'it may not have as many available apps as iphone os or android, but there are a ton of really useful ones - really too many to list.this is definitely a power users phone, so people who just want something to "work" without having to do any tweaking, etc, are probably better off with an android or iphone.' **** 'available'
---'be careful about installing apps that are always running into this memory,  cause when you plug the phone into your computer in mass storage mode,  this memory is not accessable to your phone and apps running from it will run into problems.' **** 'careful'
---'?roadsync should be able to be installed on mass memory, not c: drive.why are plenty of apps that come with the phone installed on the c: drive?' **** 'plenty'
---'the only thing i am facing right now is that there are little apps designed to the 5th edition symbian os.' **** 'little'
---'the only downside is that the nokia apps store is small compared to the apple apps store.' **** 'small'
---'the phone is incredibly slow, especially when multiple apps are open.' **** 'open'
---'really frustrating phone.complaints:-- processor is not good enough to handle phone\'s own applications -- phone freezes all the time...-- ... in order to reboot it you need to pull out the battery...-- ... and than wait for a long time for it to load...-- ... which doesn\'t happen all the time so every now and then you have to remove the battery and restart it again-- its happening now after i upgraded software, before it was an even bigger nightmare-- applications are scarce and of much lower quality than iphone apps-- constant "not enough memory" error messages.' **** 'constant'

Positive Reviews:

---'mail showed up, and all was good.' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---'so whats the point of so much space, when it cant be used for proper management.email software - doesnt support html; cant set unique notification tones for different email account, so when a new mail arrives and a person has 5 email acc setup, they will have to browse through all 5 inboxes to see which one has the new emailbrowser - satisfactory;battery - satisfactory; lasts more than a day with average usage.google apps/facebook/youtube - not satisfactory at all; facebook crashes all the time(i have finally uninstalled it), gmail app doesnt notify of new mails like it does on blackberry; google maps has great interface, but i loose connection all the time when i am out of my wifi range.multi-tasking - good feature and works well as long as all phone memory is not used up!am waiting to download the v2.0 firmware upgrade that is being so much talked about.' **** 'new'
---"that's when i learned that the n97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.annoyed, but willing to accept this limitation, i tried to put the account on my home screen, along with my exchange account." **** 'willing'
