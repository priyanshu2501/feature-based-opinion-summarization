Positive Reviews:

---'for that you go to the lumia 1020 and everything that comes with a windows phone (read: no apps)  but i have to be honest, this only needs to be as good as a cheap point and shoot.' **** 'honest'
---"has never opened inadvertently.- responsiveness: overall, very quick to open apps, browse web, etc.- build quality: very subjective, but the phone does seem to be very sturdy compared to cheap/flimsy samsung galaxy seriescons:- no expandable memory (or removable battery): this isn't a huge drawback for me now that i am using google+ auto backup and google music as i don't have to store as much on the phone itself.conclusion:this is a great all-around phone and has a unique feature set (for now)." **** 'open'

Negative Reviews:

---'it gets through a whole day of moderate use (which for me means a bunch of texting, checking facebook and twitter several times, and running some other apps several times).' **** 'other'

---'i especially like that it has almost a pure version of android (4.4 kitkat for verizon) and feels fast and powerful.' **** 'powerful'
