__________('camera',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"of course the biggest issue here is the lack of lte and i'm not going to lie, this is a problem if you want to use bandwidth intensive applications.overall, i wouldn't even say the iphone 4s is in the top 10 for its communications hardware as it was intentionally handicapped by apple.camerasthe 4s features both a front and rear camera with the front being a modest camera used mostly for self portraits, video conferencing, or making a short video of yourself." **** 'modest'
---'this is why the 4s will never have a higher rated camera than other smartphones with hardware on par with apples offerings.with that said, the lack of control is evident again in the video camera portion and it is behind the rezound in that the rezound has 2x slow motion recording.' **** 'higher'
---'2 weeks into owning the phone i was un able to use the front facing camera due to extreme glitches which disabled me from operating the devise in that app.' **** 'due'

---"i do not think the 4s is enough of an upgrade from the 4 to justify the upgrade if it means you will have to miss out on the iphone 5 (or whatever it will be called) in 2012.  yes, the 4s is a little faster, siri is pretty cool though not essential, and the camera is a tiny bit better, but other than that it's pretty much the same phone." **** 'essential'
