---'** 3/29/2013i am on my second one of this phone, the first one developed a hair line crack on the screen, i have not dropped it but noticed this after i got the phone for several months, amazon replaced the phone and it is very nice of them to do this.continue to use this windows 8 phone, now it starts to catch up with more users, i still think the phone itself (samsung) is not of highest quality, and it is a little bit dated both in the screen size and battery usage time, i looked at a few other choices, i think nokia and htc are better.' **** 'highest'

---"of course, headphones or a portable speaker are always going to be better for listening when you don't get the luxury of silence.build quality and feel(without a case or skin): 7/10the build quality is very good and the phone is really light." **** 'good'
---'so while the windows marketplace lacks a few key apps, it also does lack many of the low quality apps on the other two.overall, the samsung focus s is a great phone and those who need a phone, like the windows phone os, or really need a phone that integrates all the microsoft services into one.' **** 'low'

---'battery life has been good--makes it through the whole day with plenty of juice to spare.only knock i can really give the phone is the dearth of apps compared to android and apple; however, the windows phone has only been out for one year and already has about 40,000 apps in the marketplace and the number is growing rapidly.bottom line:  you should try this phone!' **** 'dearth'
---'however, if you do not wish to travel that route, then the social networking apps are beautiful and swift.if the number of apps is what you are concerned with, microsoft just announced today to have over 100,000 different apps for windows phone 7. within that marketplace, there is a guarantee to have anything you need that any competitor can offer.the future:the future of windows phone is even more exciting.' **** 'beautiful'

---"i seriously can't even find a single thing i don't like about this phone!" **** 'single'
---'in november of 2011 windows phones won the operating system of the year which was judged at the 2011 know your mobile awards.the most important thing about a smart phone should be security, and that in itself should exclude any and all androids.' **** 'important'
---'if the phone number is not in the history calls you made, another button, you need to press to bring up the phone directory or dial pad to dial he number, it is nightmarish if you try this in the dark, as the  key is not lighted, you end up trying several times before you can even start to make a call.one thing i absolutely hate it in this phone is the microsoft bing search button, it is right there in the lower front panel, next to the windows pan button, it is sensitive, and you can inadvertently bring this search page up, and you have no intention to, which just makes your life difficult, especially you are on the go and you want to make a quick phone call.the lay out of the side button for camera activation is another aggravating point of this phone, it is right there where you held your phone, and if you grab your phone and sometimes, it just turn on the camera, you lost whatever you are doing at the time, bad design.on top of it, the battery life is not good, i do not think i am a typical heavy user of the phone, with one day use, my battery bar is down to 50%, i almost have to charge the phone constantly in a daily basis.this is straightly out of my own user experience owing this phone almost a month now, there are other minor inconvenient points that i consider just not worth of mentioning comparing with the above user interface experience, overall, not a very good phone.' **** 'hate'
