---"the camera is ok, the marketplace is easy to manage, the live tiles realy does give the phone a different feel when compared to the static icons on other phones so generally its a decent phone however and here's the downsides, it requires an update to the 7.5 to have access to the marketplace, this is a timely drag." **** 'easy'

---'the built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience, but of course, the image quality is much lower than using a digital camera.user interfacemicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in wp7 (now wp7.5) with "metro".' **** 'much'
---'voice quality has been good, but there have been reports of echoing from people on the other end of the calls.value: 5/5at $240 i will save $200 or more during my first year on at&t;, and $400 or more during my second year.' **** 'good'
---"here's a pros cons list to help out...pros* very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen i've used* very easy to learn the functions included* a lot of customization options included in interface* uses standard micro-usb charger* has x-box live capabilities* a generous sized screen* can use internet over wi-fi* zune music and videocons* battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours* if on t-mobile or other carrier besides at&t; cannot send or receive pictures* low quality cameraanother heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current x-box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone." **** 'low'
