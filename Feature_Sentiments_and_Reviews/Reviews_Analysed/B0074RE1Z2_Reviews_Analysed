__________('something',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'there is also an occasional freeze on the older android os such as gingerbread and froyo (not so much with ics and jelly bean though)  the iphone os, however, is more simplified for a novice because it has a predefined layout that every user would see and no widgets (i had a feeling that she was going to hold down on the screen too long and delete or move something and wonder what happened to it)  so i thought this was a perfect choice for her.my wife was surprised by the change.' **** 'delete'

Negative Reviews:

---'the new notification is very useful and being able to still get into my notification center while in a game or other full screen apps is a big plus for me.conclusion:i do recommend this phone to those who want something simple, easy, and have something reliable at all times.' **** 'reliable'
---'i had a horrible experience, and i do not know why they advertise something that is not true.' **** 'true'

---"got the iphone 4s brand new and i got a otterbox defender well i was at it and i never took it out of the case and everything was great till the wi-fi stopped working and my data connection got incredible slow that it was pain full i called sprint to see why my data was slow and they didn't know why and told me to call apple care, so i got on the phone with apple care and because of one damn day i was over my 1 year warranty and they wanted me to pay $100.00 for care and to talk to a apple tech which because i was tight on money i couldn't get the problem fixed so now i live with slow data even for 3g standards and my wi-fi option is grayed out and wont turn on went on apple.com and youtube.com an it said to reset network settings which and it didn't work so i went to method number 2 which was to erase all my data and reinstall the os back to 6.1.3 and that didn't do anything so now when i want to install a app or update a app over 50 mb i have to connect to itunes thought my data transfer cable / charger which has become a pain in the a** and a innocence going to get the samsung galaxy s3 at metropcs officially done with apple and ios, android has so much more to offer for way less." **** 'tight'
