__________('battery', 'life')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"the screen being big is also a good thing since it makes things such as text easier to see so you can do other things such as reading a book for example.the 8 mp camera takes great clear photos and the video isn't bad either.it comes with android gingerbread (v 2.3) but with the samsung keis software you can easily upgrade the phone to jellybean (v 4.1.2)what i don't like about this phone is the the battery life is very poor." **** 'poor'
---'hd video, great recorder, specially if your a creative musicians and want to do some quick field recording, quality is so good you can work it on your daw software and get decent cd quality.consthe microusb charging dort had to be replaced as it stopped functioning, no charge nor usb 2 computer capabilites, luckly kies software as it works by wifi or blutooth, still slow compared to standard 2.0 usb ports.the sylus pen, you can use it, but you cant really write or draw very precisly, ive worked on this for almost two years, i draw, trust me, this stylus feature is not something youll be using alot, its not that good, if ever the time comes you want to use it.battery life is very poor, this is because of the huge output on the fantastic hd led sreen, but anker sells on amazon these great wallcharger and 2 higher ampage battery for like 25 bucks, better quality than stock battery.conclusionthis is an outstanding phone for a smartphone power user.' **** 'poor'

---'hd video, great recorder, specially if your a creative musicians and want to do some quick field recording, quality is so good you can work it on your daw software and get decent cd quality.consthe microusb charging dort had to be replaced as it stopped functioning, no charge nor usb 2 computer capabilites, luckly kies software as it works by wifi or blutooth, still slow compared to standard 2.0 usb ports.the sylus pen, you can use it, but you cant really write or draw very precisly, ive worked on this for almost two years, i draw, trust me, this stylus feature is not something youll be using alot, its not that good, if ever the time comes you want to use it.battery life is very poor, this is because of the huge output on the fantastic hd led sreen, but anker sells on amazon these great wallcharger and 2 higher ampage battery for like 25 bucks, better quality than stock battery.conclusionthis is an outstanding phone for a smartphone power user.' **** 'good'
---"this is what you want to get if you don't want to have both a phone and tablet, its small enough to be a phone, and large enough to be a tablet.ive had this phone for almost two years and still dont find convinced to switch, not even to my wifes and friends s3's and nexus phones.if you want this type of screen for your daily use, i recomend to get the note ii, its faster, stylus pen works alot better.samsung should put in better quality usb port charger." **** 'better'
---'its hard to believe that samsung put their name on a product like this and amazon is even selling it wow, well i guess that\'s what happen when these big corporation "make it they" start producing low quality product... they know longer offer value for your money thank you samsung for showing me that even an organization like yours can produce that type of standard...' **** 'low'

Positive Reviews:

---"the screen being big is also a good thing since it makes things such as text easier to see so you can do other things such as reading a book for example.the 8 mp camera takes great clear photos and the video isn't bad either.it comes with android gingerbread (v 2.3) but with the samsung keis software you can easily upgrade the phone to jellybean (v 4.1.2)what i don't like about this phone is the the battery life is very poor." **** 'poor'
---'hd video, great recorder, specially if your a creative musicians and want to do some quick field recording, quality is so good you can work it on your daw software and get decent cd quality.consthe microusb charging dort had to be replaced as it stopped functioning, no charge nor usb 2 computer capabilites, luckly kies software as it works by wifi or blutooth, still slow compared to standard 2.0 usb ports.the sylus pen, you can use it, but you cant really write or draw very precisly, ive worked on this for almost two years, i draw, trust me, this stylus feature is not something youll be using alot, its not that good, if ever the time comes you want to use it.battery life is very poor, this is because of the huge output on the fantastic hd led sreen, but anker sells on amazon these great wallcharger and 2 higher ampage battery for like 25 bucks, better quality than stock battery.conclusionthis is an outstanding phone for a smartphone power user.' **** 'poor'
