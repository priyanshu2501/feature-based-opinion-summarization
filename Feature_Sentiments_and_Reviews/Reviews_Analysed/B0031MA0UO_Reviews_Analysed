---'the sound quality is really nice and clear.' **** 'clear'

Negative Reviews:

---'when the phone is working properly, the sound quality is good, but the phone rings only 70% of the time for incoming calls, even though it shows a strong signal.like others have stated: the phone is sometimes slow, you constantly have to use a task killer, battery life is short, and the on-screen keypad does not always respond to touch.' **** 'good'
---'you have to reformat them in a low quality to get them to play.' **** 'low'

Positive Reviews:

---"it took several days of working with the phone to get comfortable -- changing keyboards from qwerty to compact qwerty was the single most important change -- couldn't type worth a darn with regular qwerty even after calibrating it and spending hours trying to become accurate." **** 'single'

---"compact qwerty has larger 'buttons' so most keys have two letters (as well as other characters, too) -- bottom line: i'm able to type w/o too much backspacing (regular qwerty i swear i had to hit backspace as often as any other 'key') anyway, compact qwerty saved the phone from being returned.main drawback so far is battery life." **** 'regular'
