---'it is slow, it freezes up, it needs to be rebooted frequently...sometimes i miss calls due to the sluggishness of the touchscreen not reacting to my inputs.' **** 'due'
---"this actually happened to me in an airport getting ready to take an international flight.how frustrating do you think the experience of not being able to make your last calls before your flight out of the country, would be?the phone's internal memory is an absolute joke for a smartphone.even as someone who is not heavily reliant on a cellphone, i still have managed to exhaust the phone's internal memory with the apps that i have downloaded to the phone, which is not (comparatively speaking with other people that i know), a lot." **** 'last'
