Positive Reviews:

---"straight talk is a very good carrier for anyone who doesn't like to have tie with a 2-year contract.it even offer lte services if you are in the targeted area which i find is a bonus.with this 6 months refill card, i could get my monthly rate to a even lower price." **** 'lower'
---'seems like below negative reviews reference a higher price being charged than the $270... however again, that was not the case when i purchased this (mine was $219.99).you can purchase this same card at walmart or on straighttalk.com, but not for the price offered here.' **** 'higher'
---"i've rated 5 stars for the best price i've found on a 6 month st card and for quick shipping." **** 'best'
---'this was the best price i have found.' **** 'best'

Negative Reviews:

---'no special thing when at the regular price.' **** 'regular'
---"in my experience, i was on vacation when my phone got deactivated.yes, the price may be good, but do you like to be stranded?it's probably not worth the savings of a few bucks a month if it means you are out of luck and can't make a phone call in the event that you do need to." **** 'good'
---"so the $219 card isn't as great a deal as it used to be compared to the retail price, but its still worth it if you can snag one." **** 'worth'
---'this seller was selling st cards at a discount price that must have been purchased from wal-mart or st direct at a retail price.' **** 'direct'
