__________('apps',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'yes, some key apps are missing, but the catalog is growing.' **** 'key'
---'i was really surprised that there are so many apps available.' **** 'available'
---"and they're good apps." **** 'good'
---'just so many good apps to list.the camera and video are awesome also.' **** 'good'
---'without bogging down)+ no more downloading/syncing mp3s: i can browse and stream my entire music collection over the air from my home server in real time and full quality (over 3g, of course, which is ubiquitous with verizon) using a free homebrew app (currently choose from ampache mobile or ampachpre apps coupled with the open source ampache web server) - storage limits and syncing headaches are no longer a concern+ it has a fast and capable html5 webkit-based browser under the hood, not only for surfing websites, but as the basis of the entire user interface+ it syncs flawlessly with gmail, google apps, exchange, etc., intelligently linking the same contacts from multiple sources and even syncs multiple google calendars (including reminders)+ entire interface is incredibly polished, attractive, and efficient: everything has been well thought-out and just makes sense (though the gestures are unfamiliar at first and require reading the manual / watching the videos / browsing the on-phone help to get up to speed)+ unobtrusive notifications for incoming email, texts, reminders, alarms, missed calls, etc.' **** 'google'
---'at the bottom of the screen+ the whole thing is running in a web browser engine, making app programming a simple matter of html/css/javascript (and understanding the basic app framework paradigms)+ underneath the web browser engine powering the user interface, is a linux-based os core - you can even get a command line (no jailbreaking or hacking necessary) and browse/patch/modify anything on the phone - google "web-os internals"+ because of the open, easy to program nature of the phone, there is a huge homebrew app community (google"precentral homebrew") offering many free, open source apps direct from the developers - just install preware on your phone for direct access to all officially sanctioned apps from the app catalog as well as the full collection of homebrew apps, patches, and themes+ instant access to bluetooth / wifi / airplane mode / screen brightness (with a patch) / flashlight (using camera flash led, with a patch) from any screen+ real, physical mute switch on top for meetings / doctor offices / movie theaters / etc.i\'ve owned my pre plus for over two months now, and although i love it, i have to point out some drawbacks:- rare but annoying pauses/freezes in the interface, especially when trying to do multiple interactions in quick succession, such as unmaximizing and switching apps just as a phone call is coming in and the phone app is trying to launch- although multitasking is very smooth, sometimes the processor feels barely fast enough, such as when music or video is playing and the interface becomes a little jerky- keyboard sometimes misses/repeats keys if you press too gently- screen is surprisingly scratch resistant for plastic, but it *will* get scratched if you drop it or put it in your pocket with a set of keys (like i did) - if you think this might happen to you, research screen protectors, they\'re a cheap insurance policy- pdf viewer is nearly useless, won\'t even open most pdfs (just gives you an error message)- no flash support, yet (although there is an official free youtube app) - although flash 10.1 support is promised by adobe to arrive... eventually... there\'s no telling when this will happen (although html5 video and media is catching on fast) - i haven\'t really missed this, and honestly every other smart phone is currently lacking flash as well, but there it isoverall, an incredible phone, especially at the prices they\'re going for now - verizon\'s now even offering mobile hotspot functionality (up to 5gb/mo transfer) for free (used to be an extra fee), if you use your laptop in places where you can\'t access a wifi hotspot.if you have access to a verizon store, go try one.' **** 'direct'
---'there are plenty of apps available and many outshine other smartphones like the facebook app.' **** 'available'
---'in fact, palm provides webos doctor for free, an application that will restore your pre to its original software configuration, then the pre will download all paid apps and settings from the automatic, cloud-based backup!palm has over 4000 commercially available apps, and over 5000 when including homebrew apps.' **** 'available'
---"to be used on this for free now.although there aren't as many apps for the pre vs. what the iphone or droid has, it has a lot of quality apps and appears to be growing every day." **** 'free'

Negative Reviews:

---'most apps are free or cheap - if you buy classic you can access the huge number of old palmos apps as well.' **** 'free'
---"one minute it would be fine and the next, verizon would be telling me to reset the whole phone which of course, deleted everything on the phone and even that didn't work.i find the droid very easy to work with and there are alot more apps available." **** 'available'
---"sure, it's mostly little refinements, but the memory boost makes is easy to keep a dozen apps open at a time, the storage boost lets me carry nearly my entirely music library, and the wifi hot spot ensures i always have the full internet with me, on the phone or laptop." **** 'open'
---'the great thing about webos is that apps can easily be opened, closed, and switched between when more than one is open.' **** 'open'
---'what in android takes a few finger taps, just a simple swipe of the finger can switch between open apps in webos.' **** 'open'
---'also, android keeps apps open in the background even after you "close" them, which drains battery life and processor power from other open apps.' **** 'open'
---'also, android keeps apps open in the background even after you "close" them, which drains battery life and processor power from other open apps.' **** 'open'
---'imagine doing an email for work and you have to get some information on a website, switching (swiping) between apps is so much more convenient than opening and closing one app to another like in an iphone.' **** 'convenient'
---'with the palm pre plus you can have as many as 50+ apps open at the same time!2.' **** 'open'
---'the apps store is just starting to ramp up, but the best apps so far are: commuter computer (nj transit and bart), tweed, facebook, kobo (try it, cloud reading--sorry kindle), evernote, weather channel, open table (a little buggy on the login at times), new york times reader, pandora (great!' **** 'best'
