Negative Reviews:

---'just wanted a simple touch screen phone.' **** 'simple'
---'definitely one of the best nokia phones this side of the e series (e71/72).the good:=========- the 5mp camera takes good quality pictures for a phone (yes,this is not a dedicated 5mp digital camera).- the capacitive touch screen is very accurate and has the right sensitivity to provide an adequate resonse (although sometimes a bit delayed).- great at organizing and playing both music and radio.- 16gb of provided storage.' **** 'accurate'
---'good for someone who wants a stylish touch screen phone for making calls only.i do not have data plan so cant comment on that aspect.only problem is that at times the calls drop when the phone is out to ear due to the touchscreen not getting disabled quickly.' **** 'stylish'
---'for calls, its awesome and sound quality is great the proximity sensor however does not always do a great job keeping the touch screen disabled when you have it up to your ear.' **** 'touch'
---'bought it for $309, for the price, build quality is not up to the mark.interface is good, and touch screen responds well, gps and ovi maps works well, once it finds the signal.' **** 'touch'
---'i am happy with the capacitive (like the iphone) touch screen which does not require a stylus.' **** 'touch'
---'this phone is great: the battery lasts so looong (when i was on the airplane, i listened to music for 11 hours straight full volume and the battery was still full, the camera is pretty good, its speakers are cool, the touch screen even though is not multi touch is very sensitive, and its crazy resistant, it fell off in the toilet and still work, it fell 384533498 times on the floor and it never turned off, if it gets wet still work properly, i have more than 2300 songs in it and it never gets slow, i can open and close the music folder with no problems.' **** 'touch'
