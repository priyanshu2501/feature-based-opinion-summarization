Negative Reviews:

---"i bought this for my teenage daughter along with a 16gb sd card for $20.so for well under $100 she has a decent first smartphone.she uses it to read books on the kindle app,she downloaded a mp3 type app and now downloads and listens to music via headphones(constantly:-))goes on facebook,take photos and videos,texts and calls of course and play a couple games she likes.so she's not a heavy user like her dad.this phone wont handle too many running widgets but it does play games good,run live wallpapers if you're into that and search the web okay.it has a 4 row qwerty (the top row has the numbers as well as the qwerty row) a removable battery (why manufacturers are making them these days without a keyboard or interchangeable batteries is beyond me) and a flash foe the camera and digital recorder.it's not a bad phone at all for the price just don't put too much strain on it,one task at a time and it works and looks good.for the price i definitely recommend it,just know that it doesn't come close to the phones coming out today as far as power.but  the phones coming out today will be the same way in a couple years,they basically get 'old' in roughly 6 months so you have to watch what software you downloadit does basically the same things as brand new phones just not as fast.google maps,no problem,google searches also no problem.a decent phone especially for a first smartphone.i'm telling you,my daughter is very happy with it and that's what i wanted.i guess she can multi task with it with some things cause after she gets done with her homework more often than not she can be found with her headphones on listening to her music app while also reading from her kindle app.i honestly don't know why there's so many negative reviews,i have a new and powerful smartphone and her droid 2 will literally do almost everything mine does.the droid 2 just can't run as many things at once as my phone but if they're done one at a time there's no problems.it can do basically everything and do it for a quarter the price.i haven't checked current prices but i bought my daughters droid 2 a couple months ago via amazon for $64.99 then got her a bigger sd card than mine also via amazon for half what i paid for mine out of the store.so her droid 2 can actually store a lot more info than my new phone can because she has a 16gb card and i have an 8gb.if you're new to these phones and not familiar with digital storage even 8gb is a lot.with an 8gb sd card combined with my phones internal memory i've downloaded over 250 apps not including what comes preinstalled,i've taken over 750 photos that are still stored in my phone,over an hour of video and lots of other stuff and i still have memory left.also,if this is your first smartphone you'll probably be like most everybody else and get lots of cool apps,some of them cost money but once you buy them they're always yours even if you switch phones.just sign up your new phone with the same email address and you can put all your paid apps on your new phone without paying again.i was so relieved when i found that out:-)i hope that helps,the droid 2 is a really good phone for what they're asking here.i would recommend getting an extra charger for your car,they're like $3 here on amazon,and also get a good protective cover.they make todays phone very fragile on purpose i imagine so we're forced to buy new ones in the event we drop them one too many times.my first cell phone i had back in the 90's was made like a brick,i could have literally dropped it off a roof and it would have been okay.you don't want to hop out of your car with your phone in your lap with today's phones,that's how i broke my last one:-)droid 2 is a great starter smartphone in my opinion." **** 'removable'
