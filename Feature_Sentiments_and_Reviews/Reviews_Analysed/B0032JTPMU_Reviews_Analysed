__________('sprint',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"i've never had high expectations for cell phones, starting with a basic, free sprint flip-phone and then moving onto the razr 2 years later when the razr was 2 or more years out of fashion, so naturally when i got this curve right when it came out (and was the first customer to purchase the red color at the old town pasadena sprint store) i was in awe of the phone and loved everything about it." **** 'free'

---"the unit is power intensive with it's graphic interface and media features so it's safe to say it's underpowered." **** 'safe'
---'the smaller keys may also require some adjustment, and those with dexterity or vision issues may want to consider a phone with larger buttons & display.for the tech-savvy, most of the features will be a no-brainer, but if you need help figuring out the controls, probably the most useful page in the various booklets included is page 2 of the "getting started" booklet with the traffic light on the cover.' **** 'no-brainer'

Negative Reviews:

---'i guess with blackberry, you have to pick and choose which features you really want.' **** 'blackberry'

__________('curve',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"so however long ago this curve came out in the color red - i believe it was 2 years ago, give or take a few months, is how long the factory battery lasted, and by lasted i mean, with having wifi on constantly (didn't even think about turning it off until recently) and talking and texting in moderation, i would only need to charge the phone every other day, which was for the most part better than the two phones i had previously." **** 'long'

---"it comes with a 2gb card, the call quality is great, volume is good, music playback is loud, pandora works great.in conclusion, this phone was a hit that didn't stay hit unlike the first curve which people still stand by despite the fact that it has the dreaded trackball which goes bad." **** 'first'
