__________('sprint',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"I've never had high expectations for cell phones, starting with a basic, free Sprint flip-phone and then moving onto the Razr 2 years later when the Razr was 2 or more years out of fashion, so naturally when I got this Curve right when it came out (and was the first customer to purchase the red color at the Old Town Pasadena Sprint store) I was in awe of the phone and loved everything about it." **** 'free'
---'I know all services have horror stories depending on personnel, company policy and how well coverage is in your area, but Sprint has always been reliable and its in store representatives exemplary of qualtiy customer service.' **** 'reliable'

Negative Reviews:

---'I was not able to activate this because Sprint said that I needed the "account information" for the phone.' **** 'able'
---'I bought it "new" but apparently it wasn\'t, according to Sprint.' **** 'new'
---"i have sprint htc hero and the screen on the android phone really suck and htc just introduce its sense customization so its really slow, android to me really feels like its for young kids compare to windows mobile, and the tilt screen is a plus i watch countless hours of video with out holding the phone, and it comes loaded with both work and fun features and you cant beat sprint everything data plan, so you can really use the phone as you was meant 2, about the price get it from amazon because i wasn't about to PAY 350 for it, but its worth it." **** 'beat'
---'Sprint may not be popular with the "hip" kids these days (but who cares) however I have nothing but good things to say about Sprint, as its coverage and its service are the best I\'ve ever had.' **** 'popular'
---'The brightness is good, the wallpapers look good, the phone is light, this was also the first Sprint Blackberry to have Wi-Fi which is good because even though this is not a GSM enabled device, you can use the wifi to talk on the BBM if you wish.' **** 'first'

__________('battery', 'life')__________

__________('old', 'curve')__________


Positive Reviews:

---"So however long ago this Curve came out in the color red - I believe it was 2 years ago, give or take a few months, is how long the factory battery lasted, and by lasted I mean, with having Wifi on constantly (didn't even think about turning it off until recently) and talking and texting in moderation, I would only need to charge the phone every other day, which was for the most part better than the two phones I had previously." **** 'long'
---'The Blackberry Curve 3G has been launched recently with Sprint (Model for new curve is 9330) I believe it is the same phone with a better processor and more RAM.' **** 'new'

---"I've installed a couple of freebie apps so far, and I can see how they can become addictive." **** 'addictive'
