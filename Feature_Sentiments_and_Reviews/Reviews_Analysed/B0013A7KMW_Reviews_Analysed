Positive Reviews:

---"once again, missed a few calls due to this problem too.overall, this is phone with a great concept; it's simple, e-ink supposedly uses little battery power (thus you can actually remove the battery and the display will still show what was last on the screen), and it's really affordable." **** 'due'
---"it's a superb telephone, but aside from being very good at making and receiving calls (the best i've used) there is little else the phone can do." **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"however, sadly i am disappointed:pros:-slim and sleek!-voice quality is great!-e-ink is an interesting display method.cons:-battery time is not what it is supposed to be (more like four days with about ten minutes of talking time).-tells me that my sim card is not inserted at times; thus, i have to take out the battery and reinsert my sim card (older phone never had this problem).-don't receive calls when it's claiming the sim card is out...missed quite a few phone calls because i didn't notice it's false claims.-when you take out the battery, the time and calender date is wiped; you'll have to reinsert them.-oh, and the strangest thing about mine is, is that it won't ring when it's set to vibrate and ring." **** 'receive'
---'long battery life (under my "normal" use, ie about five short calls per day, a single charge lasted me seven days--amazing!)' **** 'short'
---'the screen is col even without the flashy graphics; i like the fact that i can see the screen clear in bright sunlight without a glare.bottom line the phone is good for making calls, its tough, light weight, and i love it.oh and just so you know, your friends will make fun of this phone lol' **** 'tough'
---"it's perfect if you don't need a camera and all that stuff and just want something to call and receive calls and send text messages." **** 'receive'
