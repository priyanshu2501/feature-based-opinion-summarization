__________('12', 'megapixel', 'camera')__________


Positive Reviews:

---'it also has a fantastic and fun 12 megapixel camera that is easy to use as a standalone capture device, and also has an hdmi output and connectors for hi definition transmission.the screen looks great, case is metallic, durable, and overall weight of the device in hand feels great and the slim sleek lines add to its appeal.' **** 'easy'

Negative Reviews:

---"everything was going great until i saw the camera that is as output, i guess that's 12 megapixels but i do not like it lost the grace as well as old and better camera sold it to buy back the x6.todo iba muy bien hasta que vi la c&aacute;mara que es como salida, supongo que por los 12 megapixeles pero eso no me gusto perdio la gracia con eso asi como de c&aacute;mara antigua y mejor lo vendi para comprarme el x6 de nuevo" **** 'better'
---'meaning the day they close ovi your phone will be useless pos.yes i loved the 12megapixel camera and gps but i was buying it for international travelling where half of the feature i had to use were in wifi only... what the point of good camera when you cannot upload the picture without sim..... not so smart phone and not so smart ppl.... look at your competition facebook and social sites work seemlessly.' **** 'good'
---"i was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.the pros: good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, symbian os may be outdated but saves on battery (if i don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iphones), the gps system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular sim card, not micro, there is a micro sd slot and the total memory of 16gb is upgradable to a whole 48 gb - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and carl zeiss optics." **** 'good'
---"maybe it is not as fancy and hyped as an iphone or an android based phone but it is really cool and you get a lot of stuff that clearly exceeds the iphone or an htc android phone.to put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the samsung galaxy s and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:in the nokia n8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting hd video and also capable of displaying it on a tv really easily thanks to its hdmi socket and cable included in the bundle package." **** 'capable'

---'very responsive and the keyboard has the similar responsiveness like the iphone.' **** 'responsive'
---"opera has its own *portrait* mode qwerty keyboard, it's much better.11." **** 'much'
---'i have an android phone(droid), this nokia n8, and the latest i-touch.droid is good for business use, but somewhat fragile due to its keyboard.' **** 'due'
---'nice thing is if you are using the microusb for something like hooking up with an external hard drive or for a keyboard, you can still charge it.why 4 stars instead of 5?' **** 'drive'
---'only problem i had is the digital keyboard is too small, when you text or open the browser you hit  wrong keys very often.' **** 'small'
---"there is a lync client and ms communicator, full exchange support and soon the complete ms mobile office.now some of the issues:1) it's not an iphone.. and it never will be.. if you want a cheap iphone get a refurbished one.2) the keyboard is not smooth as an iphone.3) you might not have all the apps you want." **** 'smooth'
---"i've seen the new e7 with the slide-out qwerty keyboard and although very similar and tempting, it's missing the fm transmitter and the wrist strap holes like the n8." **** 'similar'
---'most folders can easily be reorganized (except for the settings menu).- the virtual qwerty keyboard is quite easy to use and you can install the swype app for added predictive text functionality and foreign languages.- fun features: fm transmitter which allows you to stream music from the phone to an fm radio (e.g.' **** 'easy'

---"conversely, this had so many great nokia features and hardware i hated to return it because i'm such a nokia fan...but with the recent withdrawal of nokia from the us market i felt abandoned as a long term customer.likes: excellent camera, alarm clock that works even if you power the phone off, built in ovi maps (not reliant upon the buggy network carrier), battery life, screen resolution and build quality.dislikes: cost, lack of popular applications available for download, buggy processor at times, and extremely difficult data input method.if the e7 would have the n8's camera, or the n8 the e7's keyboard i suspect it would've been easier to live with." **** 'easier'
---"didn't miss the hard keys as much as i thought i would, although i agree with the other posts that a portrait keyboard would be nice for those of us used to one-handed typing.as with all nokias, call quality and battery life were awesome." **** 'nice'

Positive Reviews:

---"the other nice thing about the phone is that it uses a real zenon flash (like a normal standalone point and shoot) instead of a led like on most phones - so the flash is more powerful.the colors are nice to add a bit of personality to your phone - and being an unlocked phone there's none of that ridiculous provider branding and glitchy applications you get when you get a phone from the wireless vendor store.nokia just released an update to the operating system (called anna) used in the phone for north america." **** 'other'

---'used this phone for about 20 days & to be honest, i was looking for an excuse to keep it...but i returned it at last...pros: great design,cool camera for daylight,sound quality is good.cons: applications run slow, shut down in the middle of the function,wifi is horrible, it cuts itself off from the internet, could not use an uninterrupted internet using wifi.night photograph quality is not good.could not run two applications at the same time without getting stuck.there are some other features i did not like but that is my personal opinion.' **** 'other'
---'compensates for the big initial expense.the n8 has other good features such as great build quality (no cheap plastic feeling), penta band (when i go abroad), and hdmi out (which is super fun to use for games,  pictures, and movies).' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---"it has now also been enhanced by the symbian anna update and now has continuous auto-focus in video recording.i finally decided to buy this phone over a year since its release for a couple of reasons which now make it a good bargain...firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand;secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and..thirdly and very importantly, the new symbian belle os update has been promised for this phone and other symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the n8 running on belle shows a modern 'android'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a symbian phone." **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---'to my surprise, both the sites played the video in the site itself, thats really great.with respect to nokia n900, every site determines it as a computer and hence will show the full page, instead of the mobile site, which is good, if the wifi or 3g is really good.with respect to nokia n8, every site determines it as a mobile and hence will first display the mobile site, but if you re-route it to the full site, still it displays the sites like charm.conclusion: with respect to internet browsing nokia n8 does great.2)  playing videos.nokia n900 has a resolution of 800x480, hence the videos look very good.nokia n8 has a resolution of 640x360, so i expected videos(good videos like hd videos) will look less attractive, but to my surprise, it looks great in nokia n8.nokia n900 can almost play any video format directly, like wmv, avi etc, including flv.' **** 'less'

---'nokia probably realize this and gives you a choice...the press is not giving nokia the credit for giving you the freedom.- nokia n8 robust hardware will still be handy after many years of use and software updates.part of the "ui problem" is due to the less tightly structured symbian ui development kit, by allowing 3rd party developers the freedom to create their own look and feel.so each app on symbian can have a different ui structure and user\'s experience may not very be consistent across different apps even though they are using the same device (n8).the less tight structure of symbian apis has proved to be a strength as symbian has evolved to support a much larger variety of hardware types with different phone form factors:- some touch screen- some t9 keypad- some qwerty keypadnokia, as a leading phone manufacturer, offers a larger choice of phone form factors for a larger customer base...that\'s the reason nokia is a leading phone manufacturer.each form factor will be preferred by different types of users, since there is a much wider consumer base.many business users will prefer a qwerty keyboard.many users will prefer a t9 keypad and find the qwerty keyboard a distraction with too many buttons...for example, they usually do not do a lot of texting or type on a computer keyboard.many people like the "feel" of a touch ui...but that also means that each app is more likely to have "touch buttons" on a different location of the screen.that means touch ui phones require the users to "look before you touch".that means with the keyboard or keypad, users can "feel" as they "touch" the phone buttons without looking.' **** 'due'

---"i bought this unlocked phone for use in south america.when it arrived i charged it up, inserted my existing sim card & powered it up.worked perfectly & connected with my carrier.it takes a little getting used to but once you know your way around it it's easy to use & operate.it doesn't have google chat which i understand they are working on.another need is a button to reopen pages you are surfing rather than having to try & tap them open which can be frustrating.one great benefit is that you can see gmail in html mode rather than mobile mode.this opens all your folder links & helps to permanently delete spam.the camera & video is out of this world for a phone.we had flooding over the last week & i was able to take high quality photos & video." **** 'delete'
---"for the androids you have to research if the phone that you r buying will be supported with the next updates (i don't have to worry about it with my n8).and you have to search for the phone that came with flash and frontal camera (nexus one or galaxy s don't comes with it), or a phone that can record a video in 720 (nexus s don't do it), i just wanna phone that have that all.iphone don't have hdmi ports (you can use it to show pictures and movies in family partys for example) or you cant expand the memory so you cant load the phone with all your music and pictures... and maybe one or two movies.i can do it... and i can do if for a half of the price." **** 'frontal'

---"it has now also been enhanced by the symbian anna update and now has continuous auto-focus in video recording.i finally decided to buy this phone over a year since its release for a couple of reasons which now make it a good bargain...firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand;secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and..thirdly and very importantly, the new symbian belle os update has been promised for this phone and other symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the n8 running on belle shows a modern 'android'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a symbian phone." **** 'continuous'

---"the n8 does every function i use a lot extremely well (calls, camera, music, browsing, texting)it is weak in the areas that i use very rarely, like networked services (third party apps, games, etc, where the selection is poor).in short as a utilitarian device i've never had a better match for myself!i've had a nokia 5800 that gave me lots of trouble, then i had a motorola droid that gave me nothing but trouble.when our point-and-shoot camera broke i decided to get this.what i realised where that i am not willing to compromise on a select few features like calls, reliability, battery life, audio quality and camera/video quality.every other device that costs twice as much as the n8 fails in at least one of those." **** 'music'

---")since january 2011 skype is available for the n8, to bad it doesn't allow video conferencing.battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with intense use, but use your car charger when navigating with maps.music player: good stuff !maps works flawless with voice turn to turn, and good old times are back where home addresses stored in contacts can be deployed directly into maps !the not so good stuff:camera lenz is unprotected, so be very carefull !the internet hyperlinks you will create on 1 of ur desktops have no unique icons, so very hard to recognize and remember.ovi store still sucks, 70% of apps are useless, get real nokia do something about this, clean up the rubbish...ovi suite for pc still sucks, useless piece of software !" **** 'bad'

Positive Reviews:

---"i bought this unlocked phone for use in south america.when it arrived i charged it up, inserted my existing sim card & powered it up.worked perfectly & connected with my carrier.it takes a little getting used to but once you know your way around it it's easy to use & operate.it doesn't have google chat which i understand they are working on.another need is a button to reopen pages you are surfing rather than having to try & tap them open which can be frustrating.one great benefit is that you can see gmail in html mode rather than mobile mode.this opens all your folder links & helps to permanently delete spam.the camera & video is out of this world for a phone.we had flooding over the last week & i was able to take high quality photos & video." **** 'delete'

---'the screen is clear and crisp, camera and video are just fantastic, gps and novi maps worked fine, i did try majority of the functions seems to be ok till now,battery life is very good some of the cons:1- screen gets too smudged with finger prints but i guess all touch screen are similar.2- it is a bit hard to take out the sim card, but at last i managed, you have to apply little bit of pressure on the card to remove it.3- the ui is a bit slow if compared to iphone4, but i had also no problem with it at all.4- bought at 549 $ and now 450 $, but this is normal if you buy a new device at it launch.conclusion:it is a very good smartphone and i think with the the new firware it will be awsome.will provide later when i fully use the phone with my observations.after one month of use:great phone, no issues what so ever awaiting for the new firmware, installed many 3rd party software without an issue so far, awaiting for the new software shortly.' **** 'little'

Positive Reviews:

---"it has now also been enhanced by the symbian anna update and now has continuous auto-focus in video recording.i finally decided to buy this phone over a year since its release for a couple of reasons which now make it a good bargain...firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand;secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and..thirdly and very importantly, the new symbian belle os update has been promised for this phone and other symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the n8 running on belle shows a modern 'android'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a symbian phone." **** 'continuous'

---'i have not found a way to tag albums using pictures on the phone or change the name of songs on the phone the way i was able to do on the n86, the 5800 and the x6.after nokia changed the way they deal with developers with regards to cost of publishing apps and the developer tools there have already been quite a lot of new apps coming for this phone like angry birds etc.there is a new web browser plus lots of other goodies coming in a future fw and then this phone will be worth 5 out of 5 stars.did i mention that the camera is by far the best on any mobile device and the design is also very attractive.the videos and the pictures you can take with this phone are just astonishing.' **** 'new'

Negative Reviews:

---"it's not like they hadn't seen what that did to the n97 and the damage it caused to nokia's reputation, but for some reason as a company nokia was incapable of listening to any criticism or learning from their mistakes.so, i use my nokia when i'm in an area where i need navigation but can't get data (nokia maps has world wide free maps that you can download and use without a data connection, even now google maps only let's you pre download a very small area), and when i think i will want to take pictures since the camera is good enough to replace a point and shoot camera." **** 'good'
---"the n8 does every function i use a lot extremely well (calls, camera, music, browsing, texting)it is weak in the areas that i use very rarely, like networked services (third party apps, games, etc, where the selection is poor).in short as a utilitarian device i've never had a better match for myself!i've had a nokia 5800 that gave me lots of trouble, then i had a motorola droid that gave me nothing but trouble.when our point-and-shoot camera broke i decided to get this.what i realised where that i am not willing to compromise on a select few features like calls, reliability, battery life, audio quality and camera/video quality.every other device that costs twice as much as the n8 fails in at least one of those." **** 'music'
---"maybe it is not as fancy and hyped as an iphone or an android based phone but it is really cool and you get a lot of stuff that clearly exceeds the iphone or an htc android phone.to put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the samsung galaxy s and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:in the nokia n8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting hd video and also capable of displaying it on a tv really easily thanks to its hdmi socket and cable included in the bundle package." **** 'capable'

Negative Reviews:

---"it has now also been enhanced by the symbian anna update and now has continuous auto-focus in video recording.i finally decided to buy this phone over a year since its release for a couple of reasons which now make it a good bargain...firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand;secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and..thirdly and very importantly, the new symbian belle os update has been promised for this phone and other symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the n8 running on belle shows a modern 'android'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a symbian phone." **** 'new'
---"the screen is like something i have never seen, the devices works super fast, the weight is unbelievable for such a big screen, and although i must say i was impressed with maemo's operating system, until they don't really work that one out, i think this new symbian is a great option.the only thing that really socked me was to fnd out that the device has no battery, not a removable one, its battery is internal so because it is still new i still haven't had the need to get the battery out, however if your device gets freezed, just press the turn off button for like ten seconds and it will reboot itself." **** 'new'
---"leave it to nokia to give you multitasking without rules or limits, and i like the familiar symbian feel it still has to it.what i didn't like:there is no customizable equalizer to fine tune the sound in the music player (only presets that don't do much of anything)." **** 'familiar'

---"they teamed up with tripadvisor to give you a feature that will provide information on restaurants, shopping, sights, etc based on your location on the gps---so you can read reviews of things that are close to you!battery- i charged it fully before using and then discharged it fully for the second usage.- takes about 2 hours on an empty battery to a full charge.- i was able to get 2 full days of moderately heavy usage on the phone before the battery ran out.- now i try to keep the battery charged up as much as possible to maintain its life.what i dislike about the:call quality- the other person on the other line sometimes reports hearing their own voice speaking, but i can't conclude whether this is the fault of the phone, or the wireless service, because it has happened just a few times.vibration- okay, well this isn't really a problem anymore, but i know other users have complained that when the phone is on silent/pager mode, the vibration when getting a text message is to quick and weak." **** 'much'
---'the screen is clear and crisp, camera and video are just fantastic, gps and novi maps worked fine, i did try majority of the functions seems to be ok till now,battery life is very good some of the cons:1- screen gets too smudged with finger prints but i guess all touch screen are similar.2- it is a bit hard to take out the sim card, but at last i managed, you have to apply little bit of pressure on the card to remove it.3- the ui is a bit slow if compared to iphone4, but i had also no problem with it at all.4- bought at 549 $ and now 450 $, but this is normal if you buy a new device at it launch.conclusion:it is a very good smartphone and i think with the the new firware it will be awsome.will provide later when i fully use the phone with my observations.after one month of use:great phone, no issues what so ever awaiting for the new firmware, installed many 3rd party software without an issue so far, awaiting for the new software shortly.' **** 'good'

---"the n8 does every function i use a lot extremely well (calls, camera, music, browsing, texting)it is weak in the areas that i use very rarely, like networked services (third party apps, games, etc, where the selection is poor).in short as a utilitarian device i've never had a better match for myself!i've had a nokia 5800 that gave me lots of trouble, then i had a motorola droid that gave me nothing but trouble.when our point-and-shoot camera broke i decided to get this.what i realised where that i am not willing to compromise on a select few features like calls, reliability, battery life, audio quality and camera/video quality.every other device that costs twice as much as the n8 fails in at least one of those." **** 'music'
---"i was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.the pros: good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, symbian os may be outdated but saves on battery (if i don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iphones), the gps system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular sim card, not micro, there is a micro sd slot and the total memory of 16gb is upgradable to a whole 48 gb - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and carl zeiss optics." **** 'good'
---'i have loaded with series, movies and lots of videoclips.xeon flash and 12mp, you cannot get better than that, this camera is superb, good pictures day and night, also hd video which allow you to record anytime you want videos with great quality... no as crappy iphone camera.3g (3.5g) signal everywhere, strong calling, messanging and internet signal everywhere, even where an iphone or other phones dont get.nice buttons, the volume control, camera, menu and locking/unlocking are just what you need... (well and the on and off button)color for everbodys taste, got mine in orange...' **** 'better'
---'had an experience of using both iphone 4 and nokia n8 phone; while iphone 4 is unbeatable interms of some of the features like the amazing "retina" display etc., nokia n8 stands out just because of the flexibility it offers; to simply put - it gives me much more freedom while using the phone - in terms of basic functions which a common (smart phone) user like me does..- got a good song to hear - just download it (instantly) to your phone - to play it whenever you want (even when no network - or without worrying about the datacharges)- copy files to & from the nokia device - without the need to rely on the proprietory utilities - you do not even need a computer to transfer - it allows transfer to pen-drives directly using the supplied cables- carry the phone to anypart of the world - without the headache of unlocking or breaking the version etc.,- gives me flexibility to have 48 gb memory with no extra cost..- to listen to music using the amazing headphones (that comes along with the device) is truly great - i feel like listening the songs from a theater.- most important - the 12 mp in-built camera - wow!' **** 'important'
---"maybe it is not as fancy and hyped as an iphone or an android based phone but it is really cool and you get a lot of stuff that clearly exceeds the iphone or an htc android phone.to put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the samsung galaxy s and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:in the nokia n8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting hd video and also capable of displaying it on a tv really easily thanks to its hdmi socket and cable included in the bundle package." **** 'capable'

---'as for apps and internet experience the nokia is clearly behind the galaxy note (and dhd) but as an allround phone the nokia n8 is the best.it is small, has good phone abilities (the htc and galaxy note really is not very good phones), reasonable internet experience, good sound, great camera, very solid, great basic functions (standby clock, alarm, shutting down when battery is low so alarm will still work) and the offline nokia maps (which is not as nice as google maps but have more functionalities and works without downloading data).' **** 'solid'

---"standby lasts 4 days if you don't use it much.the camera is by far the best camera you will find in a phone.they re-added the timed profiles feature which i found missing in earlier revisions of the symbian^3the media player is greatly improved after upgrading to belle." **** 'best'

---"i mean this phone has an fm radio, fm transmitter for use when you rent a car or need to make a quick connection to a car radio that doesn't have bluetooth or inputs, usb input, hdmi output, and what is without a doubt the best camera in a cell phone until the 808 came out." **** 'best'
---"it's not like they hadn't seen what that did to the n97 and the damage it caused to nokia's reputation, but for some reason as a company nokia was incapable of listening to any criticism or learning from their mistakes.so, i use my nokia when i'm in an area where i need navigation but can't get data (nokia maps has world wide free maps that you can download and use without a data connection, even now google maps only let's you pre download a very small area), and when i think i will want to take pictures since the camera is good enough to replace a point and shoot camera." **** 'good'

---"the n8 does every function i use a lot extremely well (calls, camera, music, browsing, texting)it is weak in the areas that i use very rarely, like networked services (third party apps, games, etc, where the selection is poor).in short as a utilitarian device i've never had a better match for myself!i've had a nokia 5800 that gave me lots of trouble, then i had a motorola droid that gave me nothing but trouble.when our point-and-shoot camera broke i decided to get this.what i realised where that i am not willing to compromise on a select few features like calls, reliability, battery life, audio quality and camera/video quality.every other device that costs twice as much as the n8 fails in at least one of those." **** 'music'
---"i was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.the pros: good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, symbian os may be outdated but saves on battery (if i don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iphones), the gps system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular sim card, not micro, there is a micro sd slot and the total memory of 16gb is upgradable to a whole 48 gb - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and carl zeiss optics." **** 'good'
---'i have loaded with series, movies and lots of videoclips.xeon flash and 12mp, you cannot get better than that, this camera is superb, good pictures day and night, also hd video which allow you to record anytime you want videos with great quality... no as crappy iphone camera.3g (3.5g) signal everywhere, strong calling, messanging and internet signal everywhere, even where an iphone or other phones dont get.nice buttons, the volume control, camera, menu and locking/unlocking are just what you need... (well and the on and off button)color for everbodys taste, got mine in orange...' **** 'better'
---"i just want a good quality phone with strong reception and loud speaker, that has a very good camera (i don't have a digital camera), with many connection options (usb on the go, bluetooth for file transferring, etc), and can also act as a pda (calendar, contacts, notes, all sync with google)." **** 'good'

---"maybe it is not as fancy and hyped as an iphone or an android based phone but it is really cool and you get a lot of stuff that clearly exceeds the iphone or an htc android phone.to put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the samsung galaxy s and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:in the nokia n8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting hd video and also capable of displaying it on a tv really easily thanks to its hdmi socket and cable included in the bundle package." **** 'capable'

---"just to you have an idea of what i'm saying, i spent at least four weeks analyzing a bunch of alternatives to this phone not limited to the smartphones category.finally, i decided for n8 for the following reasons:1 - the well known nokia battery lifetime (just don't wanted to pick an apple/moto and need daily charges (i use to charge once a week, low usage of course);2 - the camera, i thought: now we have an acceptable one that somehow can be a regular camera substitute (real substitute, take a look at the macros!" **** 'acceptable'

---'previous owner of n73, n95 8gb, n97mini, n900.have the n8 now 3 months bought it on amazon, all i can say is this is the best nokia made so far.first the good stuff:housing is solid aluminum, no plastics !upgraded memory with 32 gigs, works great.the multi tasking is smooth, the camera is absolutely amazing, pictures and video are breathtaking quality, no other cell can come even close to this quality, even digital cams have competition from this phone.the on board video editor is also a great feature, and allows you to patch audio tracks to ur clips.' **** 'best'
---")since january 2011 skype is available for the n8, to bad it doesn't allow video conferencing.battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with intense use, but use your car charger when navigating with maps.music player: good stuff !maps works flawless with voice turn to turn, and good old times are back where home addresses stored in contacts can be deployed directly into maps !the not so good stuff:camera lenz is unprotected, so be very carefull !the internet hyperlinks you will create on 1 of ur desktops have no unique icons, so very hard to recognize and remember.ovi store still sucks, 70% of apps are useless, get real nokia do something about this, clean up the rubbish...ovi suite for pc still sucks, useless piece of software !" **** 'bad'

---")since january 2011 skype is available for the n8, to bad it doesn't allow video conferencing.battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with intense use, but use your car charger when navigating with maps.music player: good stuff !maps works flawless with voice turn to turn, and good old times are back where home addresses stored in contacts can be deployed directly into maps !the not so good stuff:camera lenz is unprotected, so be very carefull !the internet hyperlinks you will create on 1 of ur desktops have no unique icons, so very hard to recognize and remember.ovi store still sucks, 70% of apps are useless, get real nokia do something about this, clean up the rubbish...ovi suite for pc still sucks, useless piece of software !" **** 'bad'

---"is slower than ipod touch 4's facebook app.not clean in appearance either.skype similarly looks untidy compared to ipod's app.camera takes nice photos but i noticed some noise in low-light conditions.my canon point&shoot; sd960 camera takes better photos but n8 is a capable enough substitute to carry.speaker is powerful for a device this small.stronger output than ipod touch 4's speaker's.i ordered nokia's custom-made blue silicone case for n8.it protects the raised camera area but of course not the lens.but the thickness of the silicone layer raises the lens up a little so it does not touch the surface the phone is left on.hdmi and fm transmitter capability are nice, i tried both and they worked well.battery lasted almost 2 days with moderate (not heavy) usage.not bad.i need to use n8's compass.how do we do that?need an app." **** 'capable'
---"have friends with the blue, silver and black ones, i feel like if we where the power rangers or something like that... lol...symbian, has been worked on.. i just wonder, what if nokia had spend more time working on symbian than wasting time on maemo and meego.. how greater could it be..please nokia do not get rid of symbian, invest more time and work on it.. keep it going on..also, gps, which is a great feature... trust me, in this phone you will have anything you need for communicating, gaming on the go, listening to your fav music, watching movies, series and more, taking pics and videos whenever you want.consmaybe just one desing flaw... stereo speakers for this phone are placed on the same spot... which makes not a lot of sense, why couldn't them be on the sides like the n900 or both on oposites sides on the same face like the n82.conclusionas of today july 2011, you cannot get a better phone for the price/quality/greatness/support/features as the nokia n8." **** 'rid'

---'no need to bother skype which is not available for nokia n8.the built-in web browser is already very nice to show web pages with multi-touch to zoom, flash to play youtube, java 2.1 to play java game.' **** 'available'
---"my brother has one...but nokia n8 is also a great phone, but with different purposes..for example the camera and the gps are great, reaaaaaally good on the nokia, and not so great on the iphone.but the iphone ui (user interface) sure is better and faster to go around then the nokia..the freedom i have with nokia n8 is, for me, the best thing possible, and i wouldn't trade it for any other phone..i'm a biologist (botanist) and the camera and the gps from this phone made my decision!a plus: the microsd cards are a great way to share photos, music and video with my pc without having to do it through itunes (which i reaaaaally hate doing =d)i'm using a 16gb microsd memory and then whenever i want to move the pics or songs to/from my pc i just take it off and plug it into my computer and voil&aacute;!!!!" **** 'good'

---"i was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.the pros: good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, symbian os may be outdated but saves on battery (if i don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iphones), the gps system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular sim card, not micro, there is a micro sd slot and the total memory of 16gb is upgradable to a whole 48 gb - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and carl zeiss optics." **** 'good'
---'i have loaded with series, movies and lots of videoclips.xeon flash and 12mp, you cannot get better than that, this camera is superb, good pictures day and night, also hd video which allow you to record anytime you want videos with great quality... no as crappy iphone camera.3g (3.5g) signal everywhere, strong calling, messanging and internet signal everywhere, even where an iphone or other phones dont get.nice buttons, the volume control, camera, menu and locking/unlocking are just what you need... (well and the on and off button)color for everbodys taste, got mine in orange...' **** 'better'
---'had an experience of using both iphone 4 and nokia n8 phone; while iphone 4 is unbeatable interms of some of the features like the amazing "retina" display etc., nokia n8 stands out just because of the flexibility it offers; to simply put - it gives me much more freedom while using the phone - in terms of basic functions which a common (smart phone) user like me does..- got a good song to hear - just download it (instantly) to your phone - to play it whenever you want (even when no network - or without worrying about the datacharges)- copy files to & from the nokia device - without the need to rely on the proprietory utilities - you do not even need a computer to transfer - it allows transfer to pen-drives directly using the supplied cables- carry the phone to anypart of the world - without the headache of unlocking or breaking the version etc.,- gives me flexibility to have 48 gb memory with no extra cost..- to listen to music using the amazing headphones (that comes along with the device) is truly great - i feel like listening the songs from a theater.- most important - the 12 mp in-built camera - wow!' **** 'important'
---"maybe it is not as fancy and hyped as an iphone or an android based phone but it is really cool and you get a lot of stuff that clearly exceeds the iphone or an htc android phone.to put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the samsung galaxy s and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:in the nokia n8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting hd video and also capable of displaying it on a tv really easily thanks to its hdmi socket and cable included in the bundle package." **** 'capable'

---'i bought this mobile phone last summer and i was fascinated with the touch screen, camera, and the additional features downloaded from ovi store.around the months, i noticed that one problem with this n8 is the processor; it is too slow to manage all the features of the device.' **** 'touch'

---'for added protection (and if you pay us $399 for a phone you better be concerned), get an otterbox case, which comes with a free screen protector.' **** 'free'
---'!obviously, this phone has its shortcomings and trade offs, and many reviews here describe them accurately.for me, the cons are,-  screen could have been larger,-  clunky user interface-  soon to be obsolete os-  speaker on the back of the phone right below the camera module, significantly reduces the sound volume if the phone is lying on bed speaker facing downwards.-  app store experience could have been better.however, it has been more good experience than bad.' **** 'larger'
---"as for the using it as modem ( or teethering ) to share internet either usb or wifi ( you need to download software to use this feature ) to laptop it is very dependable with good strong signal with 3g .as for picture quality of it's camera --- it is the best so far with very good quality pictures except if it's in the dark but with broad daylight 5 stars with focus .only thing i'm not yet maybe used to this phone , is it's touch screen only function especially typing c/o i have big fingers so it slow me down and having some difficulty ." **** 'touch'

---'for instance, i set silent mode to vibrate (albeit anemically, see above), but 2 times now, i have found the phone snapped back to the default of "no vibrate"lockup on incoming call.at least a couple of times a month, the screen becomes unresponsive as i am getting a phone call.it seems like the phone is doing something else and sometimes becomes responsive, but only after the caller has hung up.camera:white balance.it\'s really unpredictable.' **** 'unresponsive'

---'if the airport one day restricted me to only bring one phone, my nokia n8 would be my main choice (however, if money was not an issue, i would consider replacing it with the 808 pureview).greatest disadvantages are: new apps are often not made for symbian (and old apps are often not updated for symbian), sometimes the phone is a bit sluggish (especially when i need a quick photo), screen not as responsive as my android devices, keyboard far behind the extremely quick samsung note slideit keyboard (but then again, so is all other small keyboards)' **** 'responsive'

---"i was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.the pros: good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, symbian os may be outdated but saves on battery (if i don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iphones), the gps system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular sim card, not micro, there is a micro sd slot and the total memory of 16gb is upgradable to a whole 48 gb - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and carl zeiss optics." **** 'good'
---'i have loaded with series, movies and lots of videoclips.xeon flash and 12mp, you cannot get better than that, this camera is superb, good pictures day and night, also hd video which allow you to record anytime you want videos with great quality... no as crappy iphone camera.3g (3.5g) signal everywhere, strong calling, messanging and internet signal everywhere, even where an iphone or other phones dont get.nice buttons, the volume control, camera, menu and locking/unlocking are just what you need... (well and the on and off button)color for everbodys taste, got mine in orange...' **** 'better'

---'firstly, it is not very well suited to the symbian 3 platform which can make using the menus a time consuming exercise, worst of all being the phone book when making calls.the menu system itself does not close properly and often "closed" applications remain open after exiting.the phone is constantly trying to set the internet access to "automatic" via the cell network, an annoying feature, as by preference i will always use wifi connections.the battery life on my phone is much shorter than advertised, 1-2 days, with low to moderate use without internet.the reception on the phone is also poor, having had to swap my sim into a friend\'s blackberry to receive an important call in an area of poor reception!overall, i have owned nokia\'s for 15 years but wish i had not bought this one.' **** 'important'

---'it also has a fantastic and fun 12 megapixel camera that is easy to use as a standalone capture device, and also has an hdmi output and connectors for hi definition transmission.the screen looks great, case is metallic, durable, and overall weight of the device in hand feels great and the slim sleek lines add to its appeal.' **** 'easy'
---"i haven't tried connecting the phone to my tv via the hdmi cable yet nor have i recorded video but i'm sure if those features function properly or are similar to the quality and functions of the camera, then i'm sure they're great." **** 'sure'
---'i always have a great voice-guided gps unit, digital camera, video camera, web browser, email and phone with me...all-in-one.' **** 'digital'
---"the music player works well and the camera is the best i've seen on a phone; it has great editing tools and it can be used with an hdtv." **** 'best'
---'i think for around three hundred dollars and a few change, you get one of the best pocketable camera with video plus one of the best gps with voice instructions with free updated maps for most countries in the world for no extra charge, plus phone that actually works great and a much better bluetooth implementation.' **** 'best'

Negative Reviews:

---'this is one of the reasons i bought this phone.hdmi - amazing to view the images directly on tv and the details are really nice, but i dont use much this part.camera - the best camera you can get in a phone and the big screen is great to deal with the photos.' **** 'best'
---"everything was going great until i saw the camera that is as output, i guess that's 12 megapixels but i do not like it lost the grace as well as old and better camera sold it to buy back the x6.todo iba muy bien hasta que vi la c&aacute;mara que es como salida, supongo que por los 12 megapixeles pero eso no me gusto perdio la gracia con eso asi como de c&aacute;mara antigua y mejor lo vendi para comprarme el x6 de nuevo" **** 'better'
---'as for apps and internet experience the nokia is clearly behind the galaxy note (and dhd) but as an allround phone the nokia n8 is the best.it is small, has good phone abilities (the htc and galaxy note really is not very good phones), reasonable internet experience, good sound, great camera, very solid, great basic functions (standby clock, alarm, shutting down when battery is low so alarm will still work) and the offline nokia maps (which is not as nice as google maps but have more functionalities and works without downloading data).' **** 'solid'
---"standby lasts 4 days if you don't use it much.the camera is by far the best camera you will find in a phone.they re-added the timed profiles feature which i found missing in earlier revisions of the symbian^3the media player is greatly improved after upgrading to belle." **** 'best'
---"the camera is great, as advertised; i used it on a trip to europe and didn't regret not bringing a digital camera." **** 'digital'
---'camera is good but not as great as the other reviewers are saying.' **** 'good'
---"i was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.the pros: good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, symbian os may be outdated but saves on battery (if i don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iphones), the gps system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular sim card, not micro, there is a micro sd slot and the total memory of 16gb is upgradable to a whole 48 gb - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and carl zeiss optics." **** 'good'
---'i have loaded with series, movies and lots of videoclips.xeon flash and 12mp, you cannot get better than that, this camera is superb, good pictures day and night, also hd video which allow you to record anytime you want videos with great quality... no as crappy iphone camera.3g (3.5g) signal everywhere, strong calling, messanging and internet signal everywhere, even where an iphone or other phones dont get.nice buttons, the volume control, camera, menu and locking/unlocking are just what you need... (well and the on and off button)color for everbodys taste, got mine in orange...' **** 'better'
---"i was a nokia follower for like ever, until i bought this new from amazon, used it for about a year no issues solid phone good signal, good camera even some decent apps and great free gps.almost right after the warranty expired this phone started to behave like it was posessed, started to turn off on it's own, started to say no sim card, started to drop the signal, updated to latest software from nokia still same issues if not worse, i really tried to like this phone but believe me it's not worth it for the headaches.unfortunately i waisted almost $500 on this pos, save your money even if you get it cheap don't venture look elsewhere." **** 'good'
---"i thought the finnish factory phones were better quality?in the beginning, the only thing that acted weird was the flash on the camera: it didn't work at first, but then it started working great, and that ushered in a 4-week period when everything was good." **** 'first'

Positive Reviews:

---'firstly, it is not very well suited to the symbian 3 platform which can make using the menus a time consuming exercise, worst of all being the phone book when making calls.the menu system itself does not close properly and often "closed" applications remain open after exiting.the phone is constantly trying to set the internet access to "automatic" via the cell network, an annoying feature, as by preference i will always use wifi connections.the battery life on my phone is much shorter than advertised, 1-2 days, with low to moderate use without internet.the reception on the phone is also poor, having had to swap my sim into a friend\'s blackberry to receive an important call in an area of poor reception!overall, i have owned nokia\'s for 15 years but wish i had not bought this one.' **** 'low'
---'this is a very nice phone but the battery dose not last as advertised mine last only 2.5 days with moderate use.the screen is excelent.wi fi is cool.the gps feature worked only once and i cannot get it to work again.' **** 'moderate'
---"you'll need to back up your phone data (just to be safe) before you apply the update.in using anna for the last three days, the phone seems much more stable." **** 'last'
---'the first 2 days were scary i was so clueless but you can search for n8 help on the web and lots of forums out there and then it because intuitive and you start knowing how to do things.' **** 'first'
---"is slower than ipod touch 4's facebook app.not clean in appearance either.skype similarly looks untidy compared to ipod's app.camera takes nice photos but i noticed some noise in low-light conditions.my canon point&shoot; sd960 camera takes better photos but n8 is a capable enough substitute to carry.speaker is powerful for a device this small.stronger output than ipod touch 4's speaker's.i ordered nokia's custom-made blue silicone case for n8.it protects the raised camera area but of course not the lens.but the thickness of the silicone layer raises the lens up a little so it does not touch the surface the phone is left on.hdmi and fm transmitter capability are nice, i tried both and they worked well.battery lasted almost 2 days with moderate (not heavy) usage.not bad.i need to use n8's compass.how do we do that?need an app." **** 'moderate'
---'!update 24.12.2010 - after 4 days it died again being able to start it up again after waiting a few hours doing the same tricks again.' **** 'able'
---"world's first penta band phone.my experience with nokia n8:great call quality for both voice and video calls.excellent signal/reception.12 mp camera with great picture quality.video recording in hd.excellent build quality.battery life is very good (easy two days with daily 2-3 hrs of music, 2-3 hrs of radio, 2-3 hrs online, 100+ minutes of calls; wifi, 3g, bluetooth are always on.hdmi out with 5.1 dolby digital sound.......awesome, added a new dimension to my ht systemfm transmitter (i play my favorite tunes and mix whenever i am with my friends, in their car)gps with voice guided navigation, which does not require data connection.file sharing (pictures, ringtone, video clips, documents, etc) and sync with my macbook via bluetooth (iphone users wouldn't know what i am talking about).usb on the go... really handy when i want to share a large file with friends (my n8 reads usb flash drive as well as external hard drive).true multitasking... it does not restrict you from doing what you need and want to do...things i miss on my n8: full keyboard of e90 and touch interface/experience of iphone.imho, n8 is way better than other eye candies out there...my previous phones:iphone3ghtc touch pronokia e90htc xda" **** 'daily'
---"i got to tell that the phone has gone well beyond my expectations (in my first few days of use) and i've started loving it since i received it." **** 'first'
---'broke cellphone,is just turning on but wont work with any sim card,just stay in offline mode.i order it on my friend adress in us and he sent it to me in afghanistan because the seller dont want to sent via apo/ae and i received the phone bit later,warranty was just 30 days and they dont want it back,so i pay other 70 dollars to fix it.be aware.' **** 'want'
---'i was very disappointed that the first one failed in 31 days.' **** 'first'

Negative Reviews:

---'used this phone for about 20 days & to be honest, i was looking for an excuse to keep it...but i returned it at last...pros: great design,cool camera for daylight,sound quality is good.cons: applications run slow, shut down in the middle of the function,wifi is horrible, it cuts itself off from the internet, could not use an uninterrupted internet using wifi.night photograph quality is not good.could not run two applications at the same time without getting stuck.there are some other features i did not like but that is my personal opinion.' **** 'honest'
---'believe me, with just couple of days of use, every unintuitive ui would become intuitive (i am a symbian veteran and it feels very intuitive to me).' **** 'couple'
---'i expect about 1 day of heavy use which i have gotten for the past few days and with time i will need to charge during the day i am sure.' **** 'past'
---'after a couple of days i noticed it would freeze for 1 second here and there but i thought no biggie.' **** 'second'
---'less than 8 days after i have receive it the display has a big black line in the center.' **** 'less'
---"one screw wasn't holding the bottom of the phone but amazon was quick to replace it, i got a new one in just two days, i thought that there was some problem with the os because the touch screen wasn't responding but the problem was that my hands were really cold." **** 'new'
---"12mp & clarity is awesome, u don't need anything when you have this.but last few days i started to have problems as it wasn't accepting sim card." **** 'last'
---'the phone was okay or so i thought for the first few days before i started noticing some weird cons about it.' **** 'first'

---"i've bought this nokia n8 because it has thousands of features like gps, radio transmitter, 12 mp camera, nokia maps navigator, mp3 player, v&iacute;deo player (every file types), and the colour, which i choose!unfortunately, my belong n8 came death from the box." **** 'bought'

---'previous owner of n73, n95 8gb, n97mini, n900.have the n8 now 3 months bought it on amazon, all i can say is this is the best nokia made so far.first the good stuff:housing is solid aluminum, no plastics !upgraded memory with 32 gigs, works great.the multi tasking is smooth, the camera is absolutely amazing, pictures and video are breathtaking quality, no other cell can come even close to this quality, even digital cams have competition from this phone.the on board video editor is also a great feature, and allows you to patch audio tracks to ur clips.' **** 'best'
---"my first n8 i bought from amazon led me to type this review'i was looking forward to receiving my phone today.my enthusiasm vanished once i turned the phone on and saw that the phone was plagued by nokia's famous purple tint issue.gray in color and made in mexico.i downloaded the purple tint test picture and transferred it to the phone." **** 'first'
