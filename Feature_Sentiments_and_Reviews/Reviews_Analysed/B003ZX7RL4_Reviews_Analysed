---'The reason I purchased this phone is because I did not want any data plan, yet I wanted fully functional GPS, WIFI and a good camera.' **** 'good'
---'It is small, has good phone abilities (the HTC and Galaxy Note really is not very good phones), reasonable internet experience, good sound, great camera, very solid, great basic functions (standby clock, alarm, shutting down when battery is low so alarm will still work) and the offline nokia maps (which is not as nice as google maps but have more functionalities and works without downloading data).' **** 'solid'
---'Yes I loved the 12megapixel camera and GPS but I was buying it for international travelling where half of the feature I had to use were in wifi only... what the point of good camera when you cannot upload the picture without sim..... not so smart phone and not so smart ppl.... look at your competition facebook and social sites work seemlessly.' **** 'good'

---'Camera is good but not as great as the other reviewers are saying.' **** 'good'
---"The pros: Good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, Symbian OS may be outdated but saves on battery (if I don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iPhones), the GPS system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular SIM card, not micro, there is a micro SD slot and the total memory of 16GB is upgradable to a whole 48 GB - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and Carl Zeiss optics." **** 'good'

---'The music player has an easy to use interface and the sound quality is excellent.' **** 'easy'

Negative Reviews:

---'Even music player is buggy, when you delete music it keeps the empty folders unless you do some magical things in private folders and so on, not a user friendly stuff.' **** 'music'
---'You can provide a shortcut to any of your apps (including third party ones), put in a list of your favorite contacts in a scrollable bar as a widget, get access to email, music player, etc.+ Gallery is now much improved in that you can "check" multiple items at once for deletion or to email, instead of deleting one picture at a time, which was a huge problem in S60v5.+ General use is generally snappy in and out of menus.- Essentially what S60v5 should have been, it doesn\'t make huge changes other than the home screens, it just fixes up some of the bugs in S60 like the inconsistent double/single tap to open applications.- Occasionally phone felt slightly underpowered, but these cases were few and far between- Overall, the user interface (UI) is not as polished as Apple\'s iOS or Google\'s Android.' **** 'music'

---'I have the phone and it\'s a grate super smart phone100 time better than the iPhone exapt for the apps the iPhone has more (but as a "phone" N8 is better and for the apps get your self an iPad or iPod)Pros:1- best camera on a phone you can find2- very nice design- the aluminum is sooooooo cooooool and it is one part all-around and also scratch resistant3- best symbian ever (the old symbian^1 S60 5V touch was bad&lt; used it on N97 and Samsung Omnia HD- not that good)4- much faster than other phone and the photo gallery is fast5- easy to add widgets and control the home screen, ex: music player, news, weather .. etc6- so easy and fast to turn on and off the the WiFi, Bluetooth, also profile from general to meeting and so on7- battery is good and you have power saving mode that will save on battery (with normal use of calls sms and WiFi up to 2.' **** 'music'
---"Some pros- Since AT&T; does not recognize this phone as a smartphone, I was able to get the unlimited data plan.- can easily sync contacts and download updates through a computer- contains micro sd card slot for expansion- fm radio- can play a lot of music / video typesSome cons- not a lot of apps- Nokia's music player is lacking in functionality especially for podcasts- upgrading the OS can cause unexpected loss of functionality" **** 'music'

---"To put things in perspective let me just say that my wife bought (almost at the same time) the Samsung Galaxy S and we've been comparing the two phones over the last couple of weeks and these are my thoughts:In the Nokia N8 you get a 12 megapixel camera capable of shooting HD video and also capable of displaying it on a TV really easily thanks to its HDMI socket and cable included in the bundle package." **** 'capable'

Negative Reviews:

Firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand; Secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and.. Thirdly and very importantly, the new Symbian Belle OS update has been promised for this phone and other Symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the N8 running on Belle shows a modern 'Android'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a Symbian phone." **** 'new'
