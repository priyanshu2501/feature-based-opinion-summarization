Negative Reviews:

---"root attempts: 1 (success first try) i loved this phone when i first got it but now that i own a note 2 the note 1 seems a little slow to load apps after having a few aftermarket background processes like yahoo mail, auto sms, multiple game auto update's etc.pros:-very fast with stock android os-dropped it twice with case and took zero damage.-even with only 8gb internal and the 8gb sd i have, i never really seemed to run out of space but using google+ auto picture/video upload feature is highly recommended because you can just delete the videos once they are on google+-pros definitely outweigh cons, so i do recommend this product but if you can afford to get a galaxy note 2... get the international n7100 instead... every thing loads faster and the 2gb ram on note 2 makes a huge difference.cons:-somewhat little laggy with jellybean 4.1 or higher-battery doesn't last very long with normal to medium-heavy use, especially after installing a jellybean rom." **** 'recommend'

---'for me the largeness while talking on the device, the incompatibility with the iphone (which is apples fault not samsungs) and the problems i experienced with the international device all caused me to switch back to my iphone 4. i still look at this device online wistfully sometimes and remember the pleasurable time we spent together :)' **** 'international'

---'very good device.' **** 'good'
---'i called the support in the us and after the usual multiple phone threads they told me it is "an international device and they can\'t help me" they gave me uk\'s customer support and this is the email i got from them:"since you purchased your handset in the us i would asume it is a us handset and therefore warranty would be within that country.it would be very costly to yourself to have the phone shipped over to the uk also so i would strongly advise contacting samsung us.if you require any further assistance, please contact samsung again and we will be more than happy to help.kind regards,krisonline support teamsamsung customer support centre"so, i called the us support again, and they told me call uk.' **** 'international'

---'simply plug the phone into your computer using the supplied data cable and launch samsung kies.' **** 'supplied'

Negative Reviews:

---"but one side benefit of the bigger size (btw, very thin) is that the mic is closer to my mouth so i don't have to speak as loudly for the other party to hear me.negative:  i could not buy this phone from amazon.com (much cheaper) because of the web based ordering system; which forces one to select a new data plan (instead of keeping my old unlimited one)." **** 'new'
---":pand, as documented on many websites, tmobile can't give 3g or 4g internet speed to this phone because it isn't compatible with their data transmission bands (although that might change at some point in future months/years).but i love the screen and the size; yes it fits fine in my pockets, but i don't wear tight jeans.i bought this to use on airplanes to watch movies, and it's a great size for that if you don't want to go as big as a tablet.also, great call sound quality and reception, and i get long battery life (with gps and wifi disabled)." **** 'compatible'

Positive Reviews:

---"root attempts: 1 (success first try) i loved this phone when i first got it but now that i own a note 2 the note 1 seems a little slow to load apps after having a few aftermarket background processes like yahoo mail, auto sms, multiple game auto update's etc.pros:-very fast with stock android os-dropped it twice with case and took zero damage.-even with only 8gb internal and the 8gb sd i have, i never really seemed to run out of space but using google+ auto picture/video upload feature is highly recommended because you can just delete the videos once they are on google+-pros definitely outweigh cons, so i do recommend this product but if you can afford to get a galaxy note 2... get the international n7100 instead... every thing loads faster and the 2gb ram on note 2 makes a huge difference.cons:-somewhat little laggy with jellybean 4.1 or higher-battery doesn't last very long with normal to medium-heavy use, especially after installing a jellybean rom." **** 'slow'
