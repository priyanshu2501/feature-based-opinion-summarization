__________('message',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"There's no zoom on the camera, it couldn't send or receive pictures even though it says it could, the phone is made as if it's made for a left handed person, the only part of this thing that is actually touch sensitive is the dial pad, which must be activated by pressing a button, when typing a message out the phone will actually get slower and slower as the message gets longer which will screw up your typing, if you start typing fast, the keys that also act as arrows will act as if you had hit them as arrows, so they will move the position of where you are typing back up into your message above, so you'll start typing the rest of your message out in the middle of an above sentence, which screws the message up, and can often be done without noticing at first." **** 'longer'
