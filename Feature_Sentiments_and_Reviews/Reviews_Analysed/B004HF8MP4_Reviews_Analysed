Positive Reviews:

---'the battery department is quite cheap and actually popped off the first time i dropped which i would not consider a strong quality for a rugged phone but it was also open at the time and hit a concrete floor which did no damage.my phone has a couple of quirks that it will often freeze for 10 to 15 seconds after hanging up, i think this is cause from the battery needing replacing, it is used and an older model phone after all.' **** 'open'
