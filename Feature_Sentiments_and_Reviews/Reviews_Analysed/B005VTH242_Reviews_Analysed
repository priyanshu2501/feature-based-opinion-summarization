Positive Reviews:

---'For the price you pay its not bad but I do have a few complaints- the battery life is extremely short, I often have to recharge it twice a day after hardly using it.- i have dropped it a couple times and each time the time changes and there is no option to reset it.... it eventually rights itself  after  afew day but for awhile the time is 7 hours ahead for days behind etc- i wanted to unlock it to use overseas but it doesnt have a sim card so its impossible where i live ( thats obviously not a fault but it would be a huge pro in my case if it worked on a sim system)' **** 'short'
