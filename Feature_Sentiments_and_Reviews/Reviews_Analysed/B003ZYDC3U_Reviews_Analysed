Positive Reviews:

---'i was able to load apps so that she can call and text free to the us as long as she has wireless.' **** 'able'
---"i was immediately drawn to this phone's quirky astheatic, and have certainly not been disappointed, it is lovely to look at!all this phone's networking features are easy to use, calls with it are clear.the physical keyboard is surprisingly spacious for such a small phone, and even my large and somewhat clumsy hands have had no trouble with it.the battery (which was my main concern after reading existing reviews) seems to last a couple of days if the phone is idle, and about 16 hours if i use it constantly.this is not a perfect smartphone by any standard.screen resolution is mediocre, images on the display are never really sharp, but neither are they intolerably blurry.many apps are incompatible, either completely, because of the specs or os, or just made largely impractical to use because of the screen's size and awkward shape.the camera is 3.1 megapixels and has no flash and very few editing options, photos taken with this phone are often grainy and distorted.the phone's speaker is quite poor, and quickly eats away at the battery life.i love this phone, it does exactly what i need and a little more, and looks great doing it, but it's not for everyone.if you're looking for a phone that will always do exactly as it's told, this isn't it.if you're looking for a phone with strong media capabilities, this certainly is not it." **** 'incompatible'

Negative Reviews:

---'very cool.even though this is a small phone, do not be fooled, this is still android we are talking about here, and you get all the advantages that it brings with it, such as apps, music, a great interface, and seamless wifi & 3g internet browsing.the average:call quality is ok, nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done.' **** 'music'
---"the only ones i would really concern myself with though is the whole shutting off thing, and the 100 mb limit thing, but the shutting off issue only happens enough to be occasionally annoying, and the limit doesn't hurt all that much, as i have all the important apps i want." **** 'important'
---'most android apps are not compatible with this model.' **** 'compatible'
---'making calls or texting are super easy, but web browsing or apps are very difficult to use due to the tiny screen size.' **** 'difficult'
