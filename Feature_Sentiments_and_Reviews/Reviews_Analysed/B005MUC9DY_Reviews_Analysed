---"if you are unsure about the sprint signal in your area, talk to the folks at the radio shack store closest to your home, as their staff are usually well informed about signal issues in their own neighborhood.the phone works great if you learn to delete apps that you don't use, move as many apps as possible to the memory card, learn to use the included task manager to clear memory after closing an app, and use the included power widget to turn off bluetooth, gps, and wireless when they are not actually needed.i also downloaded a data switch widget that makes it easy to turn off 3g when i am not on the internet." **** 'possible'
