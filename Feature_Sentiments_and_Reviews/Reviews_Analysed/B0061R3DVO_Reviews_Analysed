---'when fully charged with the extended battery, juice defender ultimate says that i had 17 hours and 50 mins of use on my phone, so to me it was well worth the cost and the sacrifice in size and weight.' **** 'extended'

---"next was the thunderbolt which has been out for a while and has been solid after a few updates and after getting an extended battery, but after my upgrade price i couldn't skip over the rezound which is technically a t-bold 2. i considered the razor more than i truly considered nexus." **** 'extended'
---"i've been debating between using the extended battery and the regular battery since before i got the phone." **** 'regular'
---"it has a really good feel for me its not ridiculously huge, but phones are starting to blur the line between tablet and phone.a few cons i noticednone haha jk~the power and volume buttons are meant to be flush with the phone it adds to the aesthetics, but makes them a little difficult to use.~beats audio only with pre-installed music and video players~lack of aftermarket support (not being an iphone or droid razr this was inevitable)for cases and screen protectors~with the extended battery the speaker phone doesn't work as well because the speaker is on the back and the extended battery makes an air pocket which wasn't there before with the regular battery.if i find the time i will try to update this review after a few more weeks with the rezound" **** 'extended'

---"the nexus's extended battery is much smaller, so it fits in the normal phone back and doesn't require a special backplate, but it doesn't actually extend battery life by much." **** 'extended'
---"(retails at $100 separately)3- 8 megapixel rear and 2 megapixel front facing cameras4- minimal bloatware5- ice cream sandwich on its waytop 3 selling points1- heavier than other phones2- battery is small (the phone works amazing with the extended battery)3- otterbox doesn't fit if using extended battery." **** 'extended'
---"the big thing with the extended battery is that it adds to the size of the phone; one reason i considered the maxx...but in the end i love the hd quality video and great audio too much to go with the maxx just for size.phone calls - works great in my area and on the road, one thing i was concerned about was call quality because of other reviews but i've had no dropped calls in the month since i've bought the phone and they are very clear quality.case - i got the holster case when i bought the phone and the phone is big, but i love it and don't mind the size.it's everything i wanted in a phone and more." **** 'extended'
---"there is no free ride here and all the speed for gps, lte, and the ui as well as the screen performance take a toll on the battery.bottom line here, either put the phone's power setting in normal mode (changes the radio to 3g / cdma only) or get the extended battery (it is the same battery as is offered for the thunderbolt but the back is different so you cannot use that without purchasing the back)." **** 'extended'
---'so, i went ahead and got the extended battery, it makes a huge difference, i get about 14 to 17 hours now with the same amount of usage.. one thing, this battery and cover does make the phone bigger, but, for me at least, that is what makes me give this a a+ rating, it is much mroe comfortbale now to talk, to type, and mainly, to play games - with normal battery, phone was a bit too thin, and i accidentally hit buttons i didnt want to when typing or gaming, again, if you are thinking of this or the hyped out razr, do yourself a favor and get this phone, hands down, the best, i mean best phone you can buy!pros - everything except battery - do yourself a favor and get the bigger battery, it last double the time and has a better feel all the way around.cons - the battery that comes with the phone - hard to type and to game, as well, it onyl lasted 8 to 10 hours on a good day!a++++' **** 'bigger'

---'if you need sunup to sundown on a single charge, i would either suggest getting the extended battery or looking at the droid razr maxx.multimedia:  honestly i would not suggest any phone as a good device for watching videos given the ubiquity of tablets, netbooks, and laptops that boast larger screens that will make the experience more enjoyable and immersive.' **** 'suggest'

---"the responsiveness isn't up to speed with the iphone yet.-beats only works on the built-in music app, and doesn't work through google music." **** 'google'
---'i used the feature in google music to have my music available offline, thinking that it would store my music in a location accessible to the stock music app on the phone, and thus, be able to use beats.' **** 'available'
---'for some reason, the location of the google music folder is very obscure and not visible to the stock music app, so in order to use the beats enhancer, you have to manually sync your music from your computer to your phone.' **** 'google'
---"google music and other players easily identify album art even if you don't have the name of the album.-general media syncing/cloud integration is a step behind the iphone, but google music is a great step in the right direction.-the stock sd card is a class 4, and works reasonably well." **** 'google'
---'it is not compatible with google music or amazaon cloud player.' **** 'google'

---"i'm not going to whip you with numbers, but the difference is striking over 3g on my droid x.  i had a number of pre-installed apps that needed updates in addition to adding some that i had on my droid x.  on smaller apps i thought the download failed because it was so fast." **** 'smaller'

---'this includes normal usage and with a bluetooth headset.cpu:  one of the things that i noticed immediately with the rezound was how much more responsive apps are compared to the droid x.  i have the "dominoes" app from amazon, and the computer turns are almost too fast (i know, a good problem to have, right?).' **** 'responsive'
