---"i love this phone, it is logical, it connects to my toyota entune phone system (music too), it has a nice large screen that rotates for even larger view, htc has excellent tech support (ask them for the 190 some pages guide, it is invaluable, i am still learning things to do with the phone, i find the phone to operate fast, i do not have a data plan so my internet use is from wifi at home and hotspots in public places, it is quickest at home (i conclude that the speed is related to the signal to the phone, with a good signal it is fast; it works well as a telephone too with good voice quality on both ends; it has several home screens for quick access to programs, you can add widgets (shortcuts) for frequently used applications, the phone has a voice system too for directing phone (i haven't used this much yet but seems a time saver), the only problem that i have occasionally is backing out of internet sites, hyc tech support suggested some things that i have not tried yet (uninstalling apps one at a time to see which one is causing the problem), this has not been enough of a problem that i have tried the suggestions, i have not used the camera much but it seems just okay, i tried out 4 smart phones before i found this one, the others would not connect for phone function to my toyota system (some non smart phones do (nokia x2-01 $100 and alcatel 871a $30, you can unlock alcatel yourself from online video)" **** 'good'
