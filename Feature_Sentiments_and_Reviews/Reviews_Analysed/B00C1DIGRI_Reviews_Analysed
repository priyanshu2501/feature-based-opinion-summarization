Positive Reviews:

---"i made the purchase around december last year and i've been using the device for a month now, let me pinpoint why i prefer this device over every other phone out there.good aspects:motions - i was primary looking for a device that had some sort of motion to skip songs and got what i wanted on the q10 as you can skip songs by holding the volume up or down button.- they way you can turn your device by just swiping your finger over the screen is amazing and makes the power button useless unless you want to turn off your device.physical keyboard - this is an enormous plus as i was completely tired of typing on the screen of my previous device,each key is properly placed and it feels comfortable at touch, at the same time i can type faster than most of my friends and makes the need of the trackpad useless in my opinion.blackberry hub - this feature is probably one of the best out there, you can easily have all your accounts set up on one place and review if there's any updates, we are talking about social networks, email accounts, text messages, phone calls, whatsapp and other apps that can be easily attached to the hub.images - they can be easily edited after being taken and the quality of hd they provide are really good except for the front camera which needs work.background apps - the way you can minimize the apps you're using and check if there's any updates on the hub or open any other app at the same time makes it a really nice feature i haven't found on any other device.keyboard shortcuts - a really nice feature that probably most don't know, you can turn your screen up by pressing certain keys of the keyboard such as w, e, r, s, d, f, z, x, c, as well as scrolling down texts with n and going back with p, you can also jump on texts a little further with the space bar and you can go back with the up arrow and space bar at the same time or even creating your own acronyms under language and input where you can easily type any acronym and the device will automatically change the acronym to the complete word.speaker - the quality is amazing you just have to unplug your earphones and try it yourself.needs work:blackberry world - is not a secret to everybody that the bb world lacks tons of apps, however one of the most recent update provided was to have the option of side-loading android apps and most of them are compatible, line can be side-loaded and attached to the blackberry hub, i even find myself using this device more for playing games than the s2.if there's any questions i'll be happy to answer them." **** 'other'

---"combined with the physical keyboard, it makes for a very easy and efficient phone to use.as an example, with the iphone, if you're in an app and you want to perform a search of the phone, you press the home screen button to move out of the app, and then gesture down to bring up the keyboard and then start typing.with the q10, if you're in an app, you gesture up to move out of the app and then start typing.if you're in an app on the iphone and you want to make a phone call, you have to move out of the app, press the phone app and if the keypad is not up, press that and then dial (tap) your call.on the q10, you move out of the app and start dialing the phone number.or if the number you want to call is a contact that's been assigned a speed dial button, then you can just hold the button and the number dials.also with the release of os 10.2.1, blackberry has finally addressed the issue regarding the lack of apps that are found on both droid and ios phones.they have done this by opening the door that allows for the  direct downloading and launching of the .apk apps that are available for droid phones.business apps, like credit card readers, invoicing and estimating programs as well as the endless host of apps that are only supported on ios and droid, can now be run on blackberry os 10 phones.my only real criticisms are of the native voice control feature, the camera, spam and the lack of call blocking (either native or via a 3rd party app." **** 'native'

Positive Reviews:

---'the look and feel of the hardware is important, but it\'s the software that you are really interacting with.i\'m assuming that anyone reading about the q10, has owned a blackberry and is aware of the blackberry os 10 and "the hub" feature, so i won\'t bother mentioning that here as others have written about it elsewhere.if you\'re a game player, than this phone, with it\'s small screen is not for you...when blackberry\'s new os 10 z10 touch screen phones came out one year ago, my carrier sent me one to replace my malfunctioning bold 9900.but using that phone (running on the new os 10.1) for business quickly proved to be a bad experience.slsewhere on amazon, i wrote a review of the z10 as a business phone.i don\'t think that i kept that phone more than a few days before i returned it and went back to my dying bold.then last november i  had read that blackberry\'s new q10 had the latest operating system update, 10.2 and the review listed the improvements to the way the phone operated as well as the features that had been returned to the phone.so, i bought one.. only to find out that the 10.2 software update had only been released in europe and canada, but not in the u.s.as a business phone, the q10 on 10.1 was a huge disappointment to use and i was going to write a review about it, but the first review listed here, written by sean p. really accurately summed up my experience at the time with the q10 and so there was no point to that.to put it mildly, trying to use the phone with blackberry os 10.1 software was time consuming and frustrating.especially if you were typing a document or even an sms and needed to edit it... the editing tools took forever to get to function..with os 10.1, text editing is nearly impossible, because the touch screen sensors wouldn\'t respond to the touch inputs.. (inputs and editing which are identical to an iphone).at the time, in my opinion, the only features that were great about the phone, are the battery life (in heavy usage, it seems to last all day), it\'s ruggedness, the width and therefore ease of use of the touch screen and the predictive typing (as much as i like the iphone, blackberry is miles ahead with that feature).i was getting ready to return my q10, when i learned about how to get the 10.2.0 update (via a "leak"... something that owners of other types of phones don\'t have to deal with).when i installed that, many of the problems with the phone, like text editing were lessened or resolved.i had also read that the 10.2.1 update was due to be released soon and so, i kept the phone, because it was at least useable and showed promise.with 10.2.0 they phone\'s screen responded more accurately to the touch inputs and reinstalled was one touch speed dialing, but only from the call screen.plus there were new features, like lock screen notifications, that i found useful and other features, like the dark screen background in the calendar, that i visually liked.but with the new os 10.2.1 update installed, it\'s like having a souped up bold 9900.the q10 running on os 10.2.1 combines a physical keyboard and the functionality of a touchscreen along with the availability of the same apps as all of the other  smart phones.back is universal one touch speed dialing from the home screen as well as the call screen.back is the organization of your contacts into category folders.back is a manual type of selective sync, where individual folders and files from your computer, can be dragged over to the phone (in the blackberry link application).once you get used to it, there is a quickness to the flow of gesturing with the q10 which, in terms of navigating around the phone, seems to be faster than the iphone 5s.' **** 'manual'

---'the look and feel of the hardware is important, but it\'s the software that you are really interacting with.i\'m assuming that anyone reading about the q10, has owned a blackberry and is aware of the blackberry os 10 and "the hub" feature, so i won\'t bother mentioning that here as others have written about it elsewhere.if you\'re a game player, than this phone, with it\'s small screen is not for you...when blackberry\'s new os 10 z10 touch screen phones came out one year ago, my carrier sent me one to replace my malfunctioning bold 9900.but using that phone (running on the new os 10.1) for business quickly proved to be a bad experience.slsewhere on amazon, i wrote a review of the z10 as a business phone.i don\'t think that i kept that phone more than a few days before i returned it and went back to my dying bold.then last november i  had read that blackberry\'s new q10 had the latest operating system update, 10.2 and the review listed the improvements to the way the phone operated as well as the features that had been returned to the phone.so, i bought one.. only to find out that the 10.2 software update had only been released in europe and canada, but not in the u.s.as a business phone, the q10 on 10.1 was a huge disappointment to use and i was going to write a review about it, but the first review listed here, written by sean p. really accurately summed up my experience at the time with the q10 and so there was no point to that.to put it mildly, trying to use the phone with blackberry os 10.1 software was time consuming and frustrating.especially if you were typing a document or even an sms and needed to edit it... the editing tools took forever to get to function..with os 10.1, text editing is nearly impossible, because the touch screen sensors wouldn\'t respond to the touch inputs.. (inputs and editing which are identical to an iphone).at the time, in my opinion, the only features that were great about the phone, are the battery life (in heavy usage, it seems to last all day), it\'s ruggedness, the width and therefore ease of use of the touch screen and the predictive typing (as much as i like the iphone, blackberry is miles ahead with that feature).i was getting ready to return my q10, when i learned about how to get the 10.2.0 update (via a "leak"... something that owners of other types of phones don\'t have to deal with).when i installed that, many of the problems with the phone, like text editing were lessened or resolved.i had also read that the 10.2.1 update was due to be released soon and so, i kept the phone, because it was at least useable and showed promise.with 10.2.0 they phone\'s screen responded more accurately to the touch inputs and reinstalled was one touch speed dialing, but only from the call screen.plus there were new features, like lock screen notifications, that i found useful and other features, like the dark screen background in the calendar, that i visually liked.but with the new os 10.2.1 update installed, it\'s like having a souped up bold 9900.the q10 running on os 10.2.1 combines a physical keyboard and the functionality of a touchscreen along with the availability of the same apps as all of the other  smart phones.back is universal one touch speed dialing from the home screen as well as the call screen.back is the organization of your contacts into category folders.back is a manual type of selective sync, where individual folders and files from your computer, can be dragged over to the phone (in the blackberry link application).once you get used to it, there is a quickness to the flow of gesturing with the q10 which, in terms of navigating around the phone, seems to be faster than the iphone 5s.' **** 'due'

---"i made the purchase around december last year and i've been using the device for a month now, let me pinpoint why i prefer this device over every other phone out there.good aspects:motions - i was primary looking for a device that had some sort of motion to skip songs and got what i wanted on the q10 as you can skip songs by holding the volume up or down button.- they way you can turn your device by just swiping your finger over the screen is amazing and makes the power button useless unless you want to turn off your device.physical keyboard - this is an enormous plus as i was completely tired of typing on the screen of my previous device,each key is properly placed and it feels comfortable at touch, at the same time i can type faster than most of my friends and makes the need of the trackpad useless in my opinion.blackberry hub - this feature is probably one of the best out there, you can easily have all your accounts set up on one place and review if there's any updates, we are talking about social networks, email accounts, text messages, phone calls, whatsapp and other apps that can be easily attached to the hub.images - they can be easily edited after being taken and the quality of hd they provide are really good except for the front camera which needs work.background apps - the way you can minimize the apps you're using and check if there's any updates on the hub or open any other app at the same time makes it a really nice feature i haven't found on any other device.keyboard shortcuts - a really nice feature that probably most don't know, you can turn your screen up by pressing certain keys of the keyboard such as w, e, r, s, d, f, z, x, c, as well as scrolling down texts with n and going back with p, you can also jump on texts a little further with the space bar and you can go back with the up arrow and space bar at the same time or even creating your own acronyms under language and input where you can easily type any acronym and the device will automatically change the acronym to the complete word.speaker - the quality is amazing you just have to unplug your earphones and try it yourself.needs work:blackberry world - is not a secret to everybody that the bb world lacks tons of apps, however one of the most recent update provided was to have the option of side-loading android apps and most of them are compatible, line can be side-loaded and attached to the blackberry hub, i even find myself using this device more for playing games than the s2.if there's any questions i'll be happy to answer them." **** 'other'

---"combined with the physical keyboard, it makes for a very easy and efficient phone to use.as an example, with the iphone, if you're in an app and you want to perform a search of the phone, you press the home screen button to move out of the app, and then gesture down to bring up the keyboard and then start typing.with the q10, if you're in an app, you gesture up to move out of the app and then start typing.if you're in an app on the iphone and you want to make a phone call, you have to move out of the app, press the phone app and if the keypad is not up, press that and then dial (tap) your call.on the q10, you move out of the app and start dialing the phone number.or if the number you want to call is a contact that's been assigned a speed dial button, then you can just hold the button and the number dials.also with the release of os 10.2.1, blackberry has finally addressed the issue regarding the lack of apps that are found on both droid and ios phones.they have done this by opening the door that allows for the  direct downloading and launching of the .apk apps that are available for droid phones.business apps, like credit card readers, invoicing and estimating programs as well as the endless host of apps that are only supported on ios and droid, can now be run on blackberry os 10 phones.my only real criticisms are of the native voice control feature, the camera, spam and the lack of call blocking (either native or via a 3rd party app." **** 'available'
