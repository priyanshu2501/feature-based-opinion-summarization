__________('battery',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'that is a major battery drainer for me - i changed the network mode to gsm only.' **** 'major'
---"i wasn't really happy, because the laggy behavior and bad battery life (i'd easily assume both are also android features).yet, i didn't lose hope and always convinced myself that there should be a proper, snappy, solid qwerty android phone out there!after researching, finally found that guy (s relay 4g) with very good/excellent reviews and thought my dreams finally came true.bought it a couple of weeks ago, and i'm really happy with it, and let me share some points with you:- lots of bloat ware (easily disabled and removed by rooting), you'll significantly get better battery and overall performance once you remove them.- camera is very good with excellent flash.- amazing battery life when compared to other android phone, i usually put it to offline mode when i go to sleep." **** 'bad'

Negative Reviews:

---'after a day of only sporadic use on the mytouch, i had less than half the battery left.' **** 'less'
---'every time i reboot the phone, i have to go through a checklist of things to fix just to help preserve the battery.' **** 'preserve'

---"system administrators on the go will love that.while the 800x480 amoled screen is kind of a downer for some who like multimedia, the 1.5ghz dual-core krait is still respectable as midrange hardware goes these days, making this phone viable for communication and interactive entertainment alike.as i am running a custom rom, i cannot reliably and accurately discuss software or battery life in all respects, but on my end the battery can run out quickly if you're not careful." **** 'careful'

__________('screen',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'solid, great screen, great keyboard long battery life easy to use.' **** 'solid'
---"we've already put many games and additional apps on the phone; it operates well in texting mode; and -- a big factor for us -- it is a wifi calling phone, meaning that any time she is in a wifi hotspot (including at home), the phone will use the wifi connection rather than the mobile data connection -- thus saving data costs, and improving download speeds.the only thing that would be nicer would be a slightly larger screen." **** 'larger'
---'the screen is nice and so is the 5 megapixel camera.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---'a perfect compromise for those who want to upgrade to touch screen but maintain touch of a qwerty keyboard.' **** 'touch'
---'it also has the swype on-screen keyboard, which is nice for a quick note.- the screen is nice and clear.' **** 'nice'
---'it also has the swype on-screen keyboard, which is nice for a quick note.- the screen is nice and clear.' **** 'clear'
---'additionally, i was not able to get mass text messages which is something i have experienced on unlocked phones and did not think would be a problem on this phone since it was locked to t-mobile.i ended up returning the phone because i decided i use my phone more for digital reading and games than anything else so i went for something with a bigger screen.' **** 'bigger'
---'it runs a recent version of android; the screen is a beautiful 4&#34; display, and the keypad seems to be good for text entry (though she could comment more on that).it also has more internal storage than many of the other comparable phones i was looking at; and it has a microsd slot for additional storage -- something that not all of the phones i checked had.' **** 'beautiful'

__________('time',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---"and while i thought most of the issues i had with web content loading on the mytouch were due to the slow 2g connection where i live, everything loads much faster with this phone!so far, my only complaints are the volume button that i keep accidentally hitting while typing, the keyboard keys aren't as raised as i would like, and i don't like that the power button isn't very prominent - i have a hard time pressing it sometimes." **** 'hard'
---"this one disobeys you most of the time and is difficult to use (note: i'm not some curmudgeonly old guy who is new to technology; i'm a computer technician)." **** 'difficult'
---"the first time it happened, i thought i'd hit a button." **** 'first'
---'i use my phone frequently throughout the day & it charges quickly & last a long time.' **** 'last'
---"not a big deal for me, still using the free version but actually planning to buy it.- the other annoying thing, is the home button always takes a sec or two to respond, don't get me wrong... it always always gets you home and never hanged or something but with a consistent delay (not a single time it took me to home screen immediately nor it took more than 1.5 sec) a consistent delay which seems like fore some reason samsung has put it on purpose!- phone calls are absolutely great, so is the network signal.- forget about the benchmarks and such things, i never done them and i don't care...as long the phone responds quickly without lags i don't really care about the benchmarks...so can't help on that.- so far haven't had any problems with wifi or bluetooth.- vibration alert is awesome!" **** 'single'

Negative Reviews:

---'(for mint pc users, this implies using the gmtp software that works every other time.' **** 'other'

__________('keyboard',)__________


Positive Reviews:

---'the package arrived 2 days early and straight out of the box, i put in my o2 sim card and its worked seamlessly since, the only limiting factor is the patchy coverage outside of the cities by o2 network, but in the cities it is very fast web browsing and even picked up on the new trailing of 4g by o2 in cork.the keyboard is very good for fast typing and the dedicated number row and multiple secondary functions on each key using the function key is a great feature.' **** 'good'
---'definitely seems like the best keyboard phone for tm.' **** 'best'
---'on the nice side, the touch keyboard is not bad and predictive text is very smart.' **** 'bad'
---'i have been disappointed in the past with the discontinuing of touchscreen phones with keyboard but this has a nice keyboard, a recent version of android and a reasonably fast cpu.' **** 'nice'

Negative Reviews:

---"the keys on this keyboard aren't as easy to use as the ones on the mytouchq, but i'm getting used to it." **** 'easy'
---"with 'gsm only,' i can get about 2 days battery time (not a heavy user).- the keyboard is nice but the space bar takes a bit of effort - you have to hit it closer to center, not off to one side." **** 'nice'
---'it also has the swype on-screen keyboard, which is nice for a quick note.- the screen is nice and clear.' **** 'nice'
---"some sellers offer unlock codes, some have it unlocked out of the box, but most likely you'll be able to use it outside of t-mobile us without much fuss or extra cost on your part.the keyboard is comfortable compared to similar phones of its generation, and moreover has plenty of space for more advanced users to modify its mappings with extra symbols or special key behaviour; even when stock, it is one key away from full ascii visible character coverage." **** 'comfortable'
---'the keyboard is fair, but the keys are too close to the keyboard surface.' **** 'fair'
