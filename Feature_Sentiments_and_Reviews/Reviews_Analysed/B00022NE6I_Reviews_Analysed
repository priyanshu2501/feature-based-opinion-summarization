---'as soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it will hang at least 5-10 times a day .a firmware upgrade is irrelevant .4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you\'ll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don\'t expect to get much done .5- if you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won\'t need bluetooth lol .basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don\'t and won\'t need (if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .i\'m an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .i\'m giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you\'re getting a nokia , don\'t get this one .' **** 'other'
---')with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook, support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on (i own the ir remote, icq and a few others), the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction.' **** 'above'

Negative Reviews:

---'beautiful screen, nice dimensions, found it very easy to set up and use (this is my first nokia).the speakerphone option seems quite good as well.the minor worries are -- protecting the screen effectively from scratching- keys are a bit on the smaller side (too much typing is not  comfortable)overall, absolutely a great buy.' **** 'first'
---'this is the best camera cell phone that ive ever had..the camera quality is really good..speaker phone is loud but not as much as the nokia 6610..i recomend this phone to buyers for its price..the bad thing is that videos can be recorded for only 10seconds although there is a 32mb memory card included..that doesnt make sense i dont know why i cant take videos longer than 10 seconds' **** 'much'

Negative Reviews:

---"most of thew reviews are high for this phone ...... my explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states ..... the difference is : until recently there have been no gsm networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago .... so no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .i have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in the middle east , almost a month before europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!)" **** 'low'
