Positive Reviews:


Negative Reviews:

---"after two 'repairs' it now has the opposite issue, where the screen won't respond at all to any touch and i have to restart it often in the hopes it will reset enough to work for awhile before it goes catatonic again.what was really disappointing is that i got a temporary replacement one v when mine went in for repair the second time, and it did exactly the same thing, which leads me to believe that this model has some serious issues.i've been in touch with htc and we've tried troubleshooting it." **** 'second'
---"resetting htc sense, clearing data and running the phone in safe mode (couldn't get it to do that) and now they've escalated it and i'm hoping they are going to call me and refund my initial purchase because i just can't afford to wait longer - i've been without my phone for weeks in repair and now it's working with very limited functionality.in my opinion, it's not worth the time and hassle to keep flogging this dead horse." **** 'worth'
