---"ok, i ordered this and here's the situation... it's for real, significantly less for unlimited talk/text and 3gigabytes of data (after you hit your 3 gigs of 4G data it still allows 2G, meaning it doesn't shut off your data).... all for $45 plus very minimal taxesNOW, that said, i gave only 4 stars because you need to go to various web pages to input your data, and it's a bit of an obstacle course, HOWEVER... while the website hung me up switching my nokia 1020 over from att to straighttalk, i called and a very savvy tech rep (if somewhat accented, making it a bit touchy to understand at times) got me through the entire process." **** 'less'
