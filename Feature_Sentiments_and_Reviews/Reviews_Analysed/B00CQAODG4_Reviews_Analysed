---'i love the live tiles and the ability to change the size of the tiles.' **** 'live'

Negative Reviews:

---"widgets i don't miss much, the tiles replace it almost mostly for me though one thing i would like would be interactive tiles where i can do things without actually going into the app.camera: lumias are known for their cameras and the pureview on this was no exception." **** 'much'
---"plus, it has a some features the iphone didn't - like a super high quality camera, wireless charging and live tiles on the home screen." **** 'live'
---"doesn't take long to adjust wp8 after ios, the live tiles are awesome and i love the ability to customize everything." **** 'live'
---"it's not a big deal and i understand that live tiles are the notification bar of windows phone 8 but i think it wouldn't have hurt having both." **** 'live'
---"pin what you want on your home screen and always know what's new in just a glance from the live tiles always showing the latest info and notifications.the quality of the phone itself is second to none!" **** 'live'
---"live tiles often don't update quickly enough to be very useful (say, battery percentage, for one), but overall kind of different and fun." **** 'live'
---"i just found myself not enjoying my 'phone experience' as days went on..the shape and heft, the button placement, the concessions you need to make (just being able to change your tiles from red to mauve does not mean customization in my book)." **** 'able'
---'you can customize the tiles and make them as big or small as you want, so if you like a picture on your phone, make the tile bigger.' **** 'small'
---"i like that live tiles of different sizes, they don't replace widgets from android but they do hold some information and flip from front to back or scroll through photos...etc.i also really like the theme aspect of wp8." **** 'live'
