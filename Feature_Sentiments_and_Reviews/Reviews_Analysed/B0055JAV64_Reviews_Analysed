---'the galaxy series is nice, but none of the new ones have an actual keyboard the way that the epic does.' **** 'actual'

Negative Reviews:

---"the keyboard sometimes doesn't register that i hit a key if i hit it too soon after hitting another key, or if i hit it twice quickly (like for fn/shift lock).problems with android os i suppose: why the fudge does my 4g turn itself back on 30 seconds after i turn it off??" **** 'key'
