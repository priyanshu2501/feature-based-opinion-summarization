Negative Reviews:

---'let me tell you all about the good first.great lcd screen.ovimaps is free; ovimaps has saved us on long trips!touch screen works well.never had a problem with hearing someone or them hearing me.speakerphone works well.comes with a 4gb memory card.not much phone memory.the non-butt-calling feature on the side is great (locking feature)the camera is adequate.the facebook app that the phone comes with is fantastic; uploading pics is so easy!i was able to pop the sim card out of my old phone and into this one, no problem.' **** 'touch'
---'; very reasonable.and the bad...keyboard is a bit small; i always make mistakes typing, and many time i press a key but it doesn\'t register.a stylus is an option to buy, and would make using the keyboard a lot easier.the ovi store needs more apps, though the free ones they do have are good (like endomondo for exercising)can\'t buy movies, which is a pity (but a blessing in disguise b/c i\'d be using the phone all the time)battery life is good if the phone is the only thing used, but when you add in music and/or internet, the battery is drained and needs recharging within a day.using the contacts is kind of a pain: if you have one contact with a home phone and cell phone saved, and then call them, the 5230 only shows that person\'s name (not if it was a call to their cell or home); this is a problem when using the "recently called" list to call that person again; you don\'t know if you\'re calling their home or cell.double-tapping the touch screen is a must much of the time (that\'s the way it\'s supposed to work), but sometimes you can single-tap the screen; i still haven\'t figured out when i can single-tap.there\'s a limited amt of personalization for the home screen.the help search feature on the phone could be more helpful (for example, if you search for "phone memory," nothing is found).some of the things i use all the time (like pairing a phone) are hard to find and there should be a shortcut or at least a feature to create a shortcut from your home screen.there are few accessories to be had for the phone, like an exercise pouch thingy (what are those armband phone things called?' **** 'touch'
---'small touches like a hidden off-screen touch point to launch the media player, smooth switching between portrait mode and landscape mode, and other nice interface design add up, and i have ended up really liking this.there are a few minor annoyances, but i can live with them.' **** 'hidden'
---'though the features are not quite as advanced, its just the basics of what i need.my first touch screen phone, its definitely  a smart phone.' **** 'first'
---'pro:please refer to [..]for a complete review of pros of the phone.con:1. the sensitivity of the touch screen is not adequate.' **** 'touch'
---'not only touch screen in my phone was terrible, but also i had to turn it off a few times since it stopped working.' **** 'touch'
