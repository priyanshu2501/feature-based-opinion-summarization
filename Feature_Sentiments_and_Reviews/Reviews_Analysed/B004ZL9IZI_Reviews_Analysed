---"my wife has a touch screen pay-as-you-go phone and she doesn't like it." **** 'touch'
---"but for 5 bucks more (than the original price) i can have a touch screen phone (even though people have reported numerous text message problems about the phone) it's all i want to spend on a cell phone at the moment.overall it's a great phone and i have not even had a single problem." **** 'touch'
---"but the phone is still far better than any other tracfone i've had (i didn't buy the 800g because i prefer a keyboard to a touch screen), and the cost is very low, which is why i gave it 5 stars." **** 'touch'
---'i first considered one of the touch screen phones tracfone was offering, but after hearing reports that you couldn\'t access the keypad during a call, i decided against it (i kept thinking about all of those automated menus these days at banks and companies, "press one for this, two for that").i have been very happy with this phone.' **** 'touch'
---'great reception - easy to text - nice screen - user friendly - make sure you lock the fey pad when not in use' **** 'nice'
---"i don't use a cell much and i love that though i've forgotten to turn it off while not in use, it still has full battery when i need it.the biggest con is that i can't figure out how to change the menu buttons on the main screen, and i'm pretty sure you can't." **** 'main'
---'i had one of these before but one morning i woke up and went to use my phone and the screen was black with some white spots on it,  it was fine when i went to bed.' **** 'black'
---':) the only downside, is its not touch screen, but hey, what can you expect, the phones $20, but it is a good phone.' **** 'touch'
---"once i get used to the phone, i doubt it will happen but the older model i was using was set up so you could go back & forth on the main screen using that button.have only used the browser to download a couple of ringtones & it was okay but don't know how it is accessing pages like google or facebook." **** 'main'

Positive Reviews:

---'camera is pretty good but for sure great for texting,got it to replace the same model when i had lost it.' **** 'good'
---"i'm really a scrooge about making $50 or more monthly payments on a cell phone when i don't even really use it except for 911 and to need to reach a few other people on-the-run, so i bought it and i love the prepaid feature so i only have to pay if i actually use the minutes, it's easy to use, includes the internet(which is a pain to get on since some pages are too big for the screen and won't show like your google email and is hard to navigate and really eats up your minutes) and text messaging as well as a small camera on the back." **** 'small'
---'pros: camera is good for 1.3 mp, service, cost, batterycons: slow, still only a 1.3 mp camera, speakerphone, dropped callsi bought this phone 1 year ago at walmart.' **** 'good'

Negative Reviews:

---'i agree the camera is not the best but it still takes ok photos - i never expect to use my mobile phone as my camera anyway.' **** 'best'
---'i stuck a 4gb micro sd card in it, and now it holds hundreds, probably a few thousand songs, with a cheap camera if you want to snap some low to medium-quality pictures.if you have some good headphones or ear-buds, you get quality music.' **** 'low'
---'the camera is good for a 1.3 mp camera, but i still will say that is not really good.' **** 'good'

---'camera feature is good with editing.' **** 'good'
---"i only hope the person responsible for this will someday feel suitably embarassed by his or her inadequacies - it's simply the worst feature of this otherwise fine product.i should also mention that, while tracfone's coverage may be good, their support forum is most definitely not." **** 'worst'

Positive Reviews:

---"once you get a memory card, the phone acts much like a usb jump drive, although ubuntu recognizes it as a mobile media player.since i've started playing around with it, i've found that the opera browser is compatible with this phone." **** 'compatible'
---'there are 2 minor flaws:1. the browser button is also the back button, so if you press back too many times, it will go to menu, and open the browser which costs 1/2 a minute to open and 1/2 a minute for every minute you are on.2.' **** 'open'
---"maybe there's some way to do it & one of the other reviews has that.one drawback that someone else has mentioned is that you can accidentally access the web browser which is next to the power/end key." **** 'key'
---"and if u unlock the phone you have to make sure that you don't press the unlock button twice or else it'll start browsing which can cost you some serious money, and the worst part about it is it'll cost you like .50 minutes to just open the browser." **** 'open'

---'web browser is absolutely useless.' **** 'useless'
---"it's possible to close the browser quickly enough to avoid a charge, but there have been a few instances where i've been distracted and didn't realize the browser had opened." **** 'possible'
