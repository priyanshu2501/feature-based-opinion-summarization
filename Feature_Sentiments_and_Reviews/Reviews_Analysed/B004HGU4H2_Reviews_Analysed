---"i'm really happy with this replacement phone." **** 'happy'
---")there is a built-in lever which pops out the battery (no more broken fingernails trying to pry a battery out of the case).nothing extends the life of a phone like a replaceable battery.___camera___b+ (better than the iphone 5 and galaxy s3)autofocus works well, you can even use the touch screen to change focus modes.the dual-action shutter (1/2 press to focus, full press to shoot) works just like a real camera!the dual-led flash is a poor replacement for a xenon flash (but way better than no flash at all) but since it also serves as a dual-led flashlight (which is quite bright) i am not complaining too loudly.the cameras photos and hd videos are acceptable, and quite good most of the time.the camera's auto setting works well in most situations, but you will need to use the other settings for action shots, macro focus, etc......when compared to point and shoot digital cameras from 10 years ago this really shines, and from that sense it preserves and captures memorable moments very well!...although it pales in comparison to our modern (and expensive) dedicated camera we usually use our droid x phones (this was not the case for some other phones we have had).___android 2.3.4 &#34;gingerbread&#34; os___a-the android flavour this phone uses is great." **** 'poor'
