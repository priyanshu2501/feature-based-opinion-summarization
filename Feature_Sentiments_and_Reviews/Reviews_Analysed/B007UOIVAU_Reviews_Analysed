---"last, while the phone comes with a quick-start guide, ac charger that splits into a usb cable, and some promo materials, it's worth it to hop out to htc.com and set up your phone:  there are tons of free apps in the marketplace, you can still use the play store (which is google's new android market), and i also use amazon's app store for android." **** 'free'
---"the recent apps button only tracks the last 6 apps (and it doesn't even do that well) and just about every app with the exception of music playing apps dies the moment you switch away." **** 'recent'
