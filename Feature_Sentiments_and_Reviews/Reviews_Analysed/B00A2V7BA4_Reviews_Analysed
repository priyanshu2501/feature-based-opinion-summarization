Negative Reviews:

---"the nokia lumia 920 is nokia's flagship phone for 2012. what this means is that nokia has packed all the latest technology into this phone.it comes with windows phone 8, which just came out in october 2012. the older windows phones will not get the new operating system, so it's a better idea to pick up a windows phone 8 device versus a cheaper windows phone 7.5. this will ensure that you will receive all the future updates.although windows phone 8 looks just like the previous version, it was actually rewritten from the ground up to include a new kernel." **** 'new'
---"i've used apple products (ipods, ipads, iphones) and i've experienced android products through coworkers and friends.i can safely say that not only is the nokia lumia 920 the best phone i've ever used, windows phone 8 is the best operating system i've ever used." **** 'best'

---'it is bad design because the glass actually sticks up higher then the phone so it will always contact first.overall, good experience except for the screen breaking' **** 'good'
---'the one-star reviewer had nothing to say about the 920 iteself, leading one to conclude that the reviewer had no actual experience with the phone, or unsupervised experience with any cellular device, for that matter.having helped my wife get her new 920 up and running, i must say -- the hardware is beautiful and wp8 a nice evolution of an already fine operating system.' **** 'actual'

---'unfortunately they usually choose the latter because the mp count is a much more marketable gimmick.so instead of honest value, we now have the madness of smartphones reaching and going beyond 10mp with little meaningful result but unnecessarily bad lowlight performance, poor dynamic range, and a big waste of storage, data usage and processing time.' **** 'dynamic'

---"additionally, the apps available for the iphone, that she uses (medical related) aren't available for wp8 so i wouldn't dream of trying to convert her even if the lumia was the right size for her.so all in all, i'm extremely happy with my decision to get the lumia 920 and i'm already looking forward to the next lumia flagship that includes a larger sensor in addition to the image stabilization :-) if you're looking for a phone that takes really good pictures then this is it.by the way, i guess it's worth mentioning a possible downside." **** 'available'
---"overall i've been impressed by the new maps apps, and drive has worked great for turn by turn navigation.there's a lot of other little tweaks here in there in the os that fix some of the silly little annoyances i noticed about windows phone 7 (text selection is much easier now, you can multi-delete text message threads, etc).the meh:honestly, other than the start screen changes, most of the major os changes on the phone seem to be behind the scenes." **** 'drive'
---'i\'m hoping the new kernel and technology stack allow for more frequent os updates, and there\'s a "mango" style update in the hopper already.hopefully the sync software gets better, and microsoft can fill in the gaps to match an experience similar to the one the zune software provided, because this really isn\'t enjoyable at all, and the features aimed at having everything content wise in the cloud are buggy at best, and broken at worst.update 3/6/2013:i\'ve had the phone for about 4 months now, and honestly, not much has changed.sync apps have gotten more stable, but none of the feature gaps between wp7/zune and wp8 have been addressed at all.' **** 'much'

---'back then, the android platform was just beginning to show its promise (when there was so much optimism about the open os, and the "don\'t be evil" mantra, before google decided to become the new apple with its practices, but i digress), but at that time the app store was small as well and lacked many of the popular apps from the iphone, but i stuck with it because i preferred the os and the future promise of the platform.' **** 'popular'
---"what i love about this phone:- camera: the photos are so awesome, you can sell your point&shoot; camera on ebay after getting this phone.- nokia apps: i didn't know i needed these apps until i use them: nokia music, gps, city lens, etc...- hardware: this baby is fast, fluided, camera button, beautiful screen, rugged, responsive.- apps: i feel like windows has all the apps i needed, i was worry but now i feel this phone has better apps since there are exclusive nokia apps and ms office apps linked to skydrive (cloud storage)." **** 'better'
---"the bottom line is if you can care less about how you look and simply want a well functioning phone that is a blast to use, has great and useful apps, and is extremely easy to set up and use then go with a windows 8 phone you won't regret it." **** 'easy'

---'if you have less than 20 installed apps, you will see no difference.' **** 'less'
---'i replaced my iphone4 and the nokia is clearly the better phone.the only downsides i can think of are that windows 8 is still a little immature, the number of apps is smaller and the phone is a bit large and heavy for people with very small hands.' **** 'smaller'
---'(tested on windows 7)cons:-no sd slot-no battery percent visible(several free apps can do this but should be built in)all in all very pleased and expecting to see windows phone market share jump considerably as a result of phones like these.' **** 'free'

---"the lumia 920 is a beautiful phone, windows phone 8 is a joy and the personalized start screen with live tiles is awesome, i love it.other people have said that it's too heavy, other people have said that there aren't enough apps for windows phone, but neither of those complaints come near to the goodness you get from the thoughtful design and amazing quality of the lumia hardware and windows phone." **** 'enough'

---"last but not least...the camera it's awesome in dark light conditions its like magic you can't believe it, and it shoots great videos as well with image stabilization...having kids this phone is great don't have to worry about carrying a separate camera.some people say the 920 might be on the hefty side, but if you put a case on your phone the weight is about the same, the 920 doesn't need a case checkout the youtube videos out there.the app store doesn't have nearly as many apps available that you can get on a iphone or android stores, but i have most of what i need." **** 'available'

Positive Reviews:

---'build quality is very good, and the phone feels like a high quality product.' **** 'good'
---'!the camera is terrific, and city lens is terrific.the phone is a little heavier than most phones, but its weight seems justified by the obvious build quality and rich suite of features.i switched from verizon to at&t.' **** 'obvious'
---'the build quality is solid.' **** 'solid'

Negative Reviews:

---'so i go check it out and i am not the least bit impressed,  well, that is not entirely true i think the build quality is great but the interface simply looks like more of the same thing i have lived with since 2009. faster yes, sharper image yes but i mean come on... to quote al pacino (movie: heat)... "give me all ya got"!!!!.' **** 'true'
---"you can also adjust certain settings such as iso and ev for more creative control.the overall build quality is superb, but with nokia, that's pretty standard." **** 'overall'
---"pros:1) best hardware.2) optical image stabilization (1st time in a cell phone).3) wire less charging built in.4) nokia drive is awesome, voice guided navigation covered in majority of the countries, you can download maps to your phone, saves cellular data bill.5) awesome camera, lot of improvement in picture sharpness after the firmware update, great video due to optical image stabilization.6) solid build quality.7) great screen resolution, can navigate the screen with gloves on.8) multiple colors to choose from, i got the red one.9) great integration of office, sharepoint, one note, sky drive, facebook into the operating system.10) windows phone operating system is little late to the party but it is well executed, like the live tiles.11) in order to appreciate the effect of live tiles you will have to use the phone, customize the home screen with the apps you like & can see live information, don't have to open the app.12) facebook messenger is integrated into the text/messenger so don't need another app to chat with facebook friends.13) facebook contacts are merged with your contacts so select a contact & swipe left you can see all their posts on facebook, twitter, and linkedin.cons:1) heavy (personal choice), i got used to it, point # 1 & 2 in pros resulted in a heavier/bulkier phone.2) limited apps in store." **** 'solid'
