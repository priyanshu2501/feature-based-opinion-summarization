---'overall just a better device love everything about it!!' **** 'better'
---"(external battery backup is highly recommended for this phone)-some games do lag with graphics.-the phone does crash multiple times even after the latest update.-samsung's &#34;smart scroll&#34; feature doesn't work half the time, and a lot of those &#34;cool&#34; features only work at least for my device when i am in really bright sunlight.all in all it is a good phone, but i don't in my opinion think it was worth going from as s3 to an s4." **** 'bright'
---"probably just loose solder inside.here's my chat with samsung so you can get a taste of the samsung support you can expect.===visitor: i think my samsung s4 solder for the usb port is coming loose.visitor: when i plug in the usb cable and hold it with pressure toward me (facing me) it charges -- but if i don't apply pressure it does not chargefernanda: i understand that the charging port on your device is loose." **** 'loose'

Positive Reviews:

---'i like touch wiz in its self it has some nice feature like swiping left/right to call or text in the address book, honestly its the little things that make life easier are the cool things.' **** 'touch'

Negative Reviews:

---"my next problem is touch wiz att absolutely bloated this phone with junk no one uses, samsung loaded it with features that let's be honest guys are cool but don't make sense in every day life." **** 'touch'
---"so don't bash samsung for lack of flash.to sum it all up, great phone with a huge processor although i can't really see a speed difference from my old phone its still cool, big bright beautifully screen with not so great battery, awesome camera and camera app, touch wiz is to bloated up but you can fix this, amazing design, but samsung is being a little shady when they represent this phone as 16gb, but once again you can fix that!so if these are things you have been looking for in your new phone and if you can over look its easy to ignore little quarks then this is the phone for you, if not get an iphone because in my opinion the gs4 and the iphone 5 are the top dogs." **** 'touch'
---'this is really nice for reading.i also liked the features on touch wiz sw. some may complain about the sw/features being all over, but it is highly customizable.so, you can turn off the things you do not like or care.a lot of nifty tools have been baked in, so i ended up uninstalling a lot of apps i used to use.' **** 'touch'
